## 0. [GaussianVLM: Scene-centric 3D Vision-Language Models using Language-aligned Gaussian Splats for Embodied Reasoning and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00886) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00886
**Authors:** Anna-Maria Halacheva, Jan-Nico Zaech, Xi Wang, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool

**Abstract:**  As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the 3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive, achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways, producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in out-of-the-domain settings.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it introduces a 3D vision-language model for scene understanding and embodied reasoning, aligning with the study of multimodal large language models.

## 1. [Populate-A-Scene: Affordance-Aware Human Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00334) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00334
**Authors:** Mengyi Shan, Zecheng He, Haoyu Ma, Felix Juefei-Xu, Peizhao Zhang, Tingbo Hou, Ching-Yao Chuang

**Abstract:**  Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator? We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization, and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without labeled affordance datasets.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 as it focuses on integrating video generation tasks with scene affordance understanding, which involves combining image/video understanding with generative tasks.

**Abstract:**  We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal understanding and reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding. We open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking.

## 3. [AI-Generated Video Detection via Perceptual Straightening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00583) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00583
**Authors:** Christian Intern\`o, Robert Geirhos, Markus Olhofer, Sunny Liu, Barbara Hammer, David Klindt

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

**Comment:** This paper closely matches criterion 6 (Video Understanding) as it introduces a novel method for detecting AI-generated videos using temporal curvature and stepwise distance in neural representation domains.

## 4. [World4Drive: End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Intention-aware Physical Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00603) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00603
**Authors:** Yupeng Zheng, Pengxuan Yang, Zebin Xing, Qichao Zhang, Yuhang Zheng, Yinfeng Gao, Pengfei Li, Teng Zhang, Zhongpu Xia, Peng Jia, Dongbin Zhao

**Abstract:**  End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence. Codes will be accessed at https://github.com/ucaszyp/World4Drive.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it presents a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework using a latent world model, which is relevant to embodied AI benchmarks and methods.

## 5. [Just Noticeable Difference for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00490) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00490
**Authors:** Zijian Chen, Yuan Tian, Yuze Sun, Wei Sun, Zicheng Zhang, Weisi Lin, Guangtao Zhai, Wenjun Zhang

**Abstract:**  Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns. This work will be available at https://github.com/zijianchen98/LMM-JND.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores perceptual boundaries and visual blind spots in large multimodal models (LMMs), which aligns with the study of Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models.

## 6. [LoD-Loc v2: Aerial Visual Localization over Low Level-of-Detail City Models using Explicit Silhouette Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00659) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00659
**Authors:** Juelin Zhu, Shuaibang Peng, Long Wang, Hanlin Tan, Yu Liu, Maojun Zhang, Shen Yan

**Abstract:**  We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models. However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes. Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2 improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) due to the introduction of new datasets and methods for aerial visual localization.

## 7. [Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00537) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00537
**Authors:** Feng Lin, Marco Chen, Haokui Zhang, Xiaotian Yu, Guangming Lu, Rong Xiao

**Abstract:**  This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models with virtually no increase in inference cost.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it refines CLIP's image representation, which is a vision-language model, through attention ablation techniques.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00224
**Authors:** Changsoo Jung, Sheikh Mannan, Jack Fitzgerald, Nathaniel Blanchard

**Abstract:**  Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale. This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods' object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results, and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) due to the introduction of a new dataset and challenges for 6D pose estimation in collaborative group work.

## 9. [GazeTarget360: Towards Gaze Target Estimation in 360-Degree for Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00253) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00253
**Authors:** Zhuangzhuang Dai, Vincent Gbouna Zakka, Luis J. Manso, Chen Li

**Abstract:**  Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of 360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes. The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly available at: https://github.com/zdai257/DisengageNet.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it introduces a system for 360-degree gaze target estimation, which is relevant to embodied/robotic AI and human-robot interaction.

## 10. [UAVD-Mamba: Deformable Token Fusion Vision Mamba for Multimodal UAV Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00849) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00849
**Authors:** Wei Li, Jiaman Tang, Yang Li, Beihao Xia, Ligang Tan, Hongmao Qin

**Abstract:**  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in traffic management, agriculture, emergency rescue, etc. However, it faces significant challenges, including occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular shapes. These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block (DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions, which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared (IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba (DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more discriminative features.

## 11. [Real-Time Inverse Kinematics for Generating Multi-Constrained Movements of Virtual Human Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00792) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00792
**Authors:** Hendric Voss, Stefan Kopp

**Abstract:**  Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK, and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00898
**Authors:** Zifu Wan, Ce Zhang, Silong Yong, Martin Q. Ma, Simon Stepputtis, Louis-Philippe Morency, Deva Ramanan, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie

**Abstract:**  Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses. Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However, these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding, enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.01012
**Authors:** Zhe Kong, Le Li, Yong Zhang, Feng Gao, Shaoshu Yang, Tao Wang, Kaihao Zhang, Zhuoliang Kang, Xiaoming Wei, Guanying Chen, Wenhan Luo

**Abstract:**  Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos. To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail generation capabilities.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00356
**Authors:** Zhiwei Yi, Xin Cheng, Jingyu Ma, Ruifei Zhu, Junwei Tian, Yuanxiu Zhou, Xinge Zhao, Hongzhe Li

**Abstract:**  Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00721
**Authors:** Xiao Zhang, Fei Wei, Yong Wang, Wenda Zhao, Feiyi Li, Xiangxiang Chu

**Abstract:**  Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement (UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies, including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/UPRE.

**Abstract:**  Accepted in the ICIP 2025   We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large, diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability, and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other human-motion applications.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00754
**Authors:** Selim Kuzucu, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Anna Kukleva, Federico Tombari, Bernt Schiele

**Abstract:**  The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and (2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks, showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for visual understanding.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00469
**Authors:** Yue Tan, Xiaoqian Hu, Hao Xue, Celso De Melo, Flora D. Salim

**Abstract:**  Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle, demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00261
**Authors:** Zhiyin Lin, Purvi Goel, Joy Yun, C. Karen Liu, Joao Pedro Araujo

**Abstract:**  Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step, lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small, offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a professional fencer.

**Authors:** Yuheng Du, Sheng Yang, Lingxuan Wang, Zhenghua Hou, Chengying Cai, Zhitao Tan, Mingxia Chen, Shi-Sheng Huang, Qiang Li

**Abstract:**  While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon).

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00752
**Authors:** Hao Xing, Kai Zhe Boey, Yuankai Wu, Darius Burschka, Gordon Cheng

**Abstract:**  Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.   Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00472
**Authors:** Ying Guo, Xi Liu, Cheng Zhen, Pengfei Yan, Xiaoming Wei

**Abstract:**  Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure, achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00373
**Authors:** Jian Jin, Fanxin Xia, Feng Ding, Xinfeng Zhang, Meiqin Liu, Yao Zhao, Weisi Lin, Lili Meng

**Abstract:**  Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00825
**Authors:** Hongxing Peng, Lide Chen, Hui Zhu, Yan Chen

**Abstract:**  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.

**Abstract:**  Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits. Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF), aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%, 17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly, PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively. This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of large-scale models in plant science.

**Authors:** Minye Shao, Xingyu Miao, Haoran Duan, Zeyu Wang, Jingkun Chen, Yawen Huang, Xian Wu, Jingjing Deng, Yang Long, Yefeng Zheng

**Abstract:**  3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient privacy, calling for reliable and efficient models suited for clinical practice. However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00566
**Authors:** Kai Zhou, Shuhai Zhang, Zeng You, Jinwu Hu, Mingkui Tan, Fei Liu

**Abstract:**  Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets, respectively.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00690
**Authors:** Keke Tang, Ziyong Du, Weilong Peng, Xiaofei Wang, Peican Zhu, Ligang Liu, Zhihong Tian

**Abstract:**  Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative, existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility. Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

**Abstract:**  Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.   Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training. Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.   Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases. Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity, confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.   Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional multi-view methods.

## 30. [Topology-Constrained Learning for Efficient Laparoscopic Liver Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00519) <a id="link30"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00519
**Authors:** Ruize Cui, Jiaan Zhang, Jialun Pei, Kai Wang, Pheng-Ann Heng, Jing Qin

**Abstract:**  Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology. Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be available at https://github.com/cuiruize/TopoNet.

**Abstract:**  Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots. Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100 agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

## 32. [Latent Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow for Higher-Fidelity Perceptual Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00447) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00447
**Authors:** Xin Luo, Menglin Zhang, Yunwei Lan, Tianyu Zhang, Rui Li, Chang Liu, Dong Liu

**Abstract:**  The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a 5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as open-source.

## 33. [ShapeEmbed: a self-supervised learning framework for 2D contour quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01009) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.01009
**Authors:** Anna Foix Romero, Craig Russell, Alexander Krull, Virginie Uhlmann

**Abstract:**  The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size, orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed, a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix, into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular relevance to biological imaging applications.

**Authors:** Yaofei Duan, Yuhao Huang, Xin Yang, Luyi Han, Xinyu Xie, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ping He, Ka-Hou Chan, Ligang Cui, Sio-Kei Im, Dong Ni, Tao Tan

**Abstract:**  Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains. Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources. Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets (three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link: https://github.com/miccai25-966/ADAptation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00916
**Authors:** Tianshi Cao, Marie-Julie Rakotosaona, Ben Poole, Federico Tombari, Michael Niemeyer

**Abstract:**  We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines. Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct problem with specialized techniques.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00724
**Authors:** Linghui Zhu, Yiming Li, Haiqin Weng, Yan Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Abstract:**  Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs, model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods (developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment, or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models. After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00043
**Authors:** Mehmet Yigit Avci, Pedro Borges, Paul Wright, Mehmet Yigitsoy, Sebastien Ourselin, Jorge Cardoso

**Abstract:**  Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing, leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.00328
**Authors:** Xuan Liu, Yinhao Ren, Marc D. Ryser, Lars J. Grimm, Joseph Y. Lo

**Abstract:**  Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker, a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455 average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%, highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis. Our dataset will be available at https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/railabs/LoGroup/mammotracker.

**Authors:** Hugo Baudchon, Arthur Ouaknine, Martin Weiss, M\'elisande Teng, Thomas R. Walla, Antoine Caron-Guay, Christopher Pal, Etienne Lalibert\'e

**Abstract:**  Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns - an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1) higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.
