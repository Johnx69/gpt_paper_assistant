## 0. [LongCat-Video Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22200) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22200
**Authors:** Meituan LongCat Team, Xunliang Cai, Qilong Huang, Zhuoliang Kang, Hongyu Li, Shijun Liang, Liya Ma, Siyu Ren, Xiaoming Wei, Rixu Xie, Tong Zhang

**Abstract:**  Video generation is a critical pathway toward world models, with efficient long video inference as a key capability. Toward this end, we introduce LongCat-Video, a foundational video generation model with 13.6B parameters, delivering strong performance across multiple video generation tasks. It particularly excels in efficient and high-quality long video generation, representing our first step toward world models. Key features include: Unified architecture for multiple tasks: Built on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) framework, LongCat-Video supports Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, and Video-Continuation tasks with a single model; Long video generation: Pretraining on Video-Continuation tasks enables LongCat-Video to maintain high quality and temporal coherence in the generation of minutes-long videos; Efficient inference: LongCat-Video generates 720p, 30fps videos within minutes by employing a coarse-to-fine generation strategy along both the temporal and spatial axes. Block Sparse Attention further enhances efficiency, particularly at high resolutions; Strong performance with multi-reward RLHF: Multi-reward RLHF training enables LongCat-Video to achieve performance on par with the latest closed-source and leading open-source models. Code and model weights are publicly available to accelerate progress in the field.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces a foundational video generation model (LongCat-Video) with multimodal capabilities (Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video-Continuation) and explores integration of video understanding with generative modeling.
**Relevance:** 10
**Novelty:** 8

## 1. [Activating Visual Context and Commonsense Reasoning through Masked Prediction in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21807) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21807
**Authors:** Jiaao Yu, Shenwei Li, Mingjie Han, Yifei Yin, Wenzheng Song, Chenghao Jia, Man Lan

**Abstract:**  Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling, which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it introduces a novel fine-tuning task for reasoning in vision-language models.
**Relevance:** 9
**Novelty:** 8

## 2. [EgoThinker: Unveiling Egocentric Reasoning with Spatio-Temporal CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23569) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23569
**Authors:** Baoqi Pei, Yifei Huang, Jilan Xu, Yuping He, Guo Chen, Fei Wu, Yu Qiao, Jiangmiao Pang

**Abstract:**  Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/EgoThinker.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 6 (Video Understanding) as it introduces a framework for egocentric video reasoning with spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision.
**Relevance:** 9

## 3. [Addressing Corner Cases in Autonomous Driving: A World Model-based Approach with Mixture of Experts and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21867) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21867
**Authors:** Haicheng Liao, Bonan Wang, Junxian Yang, Chengyue Wang, Zhengbin He, Guohui Zhang, Chengzhong Xu, Zhenning Li

**Abstract:**  Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics, and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in fully AVs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23603
**Authors:** Yuqian Yuan, Wenqiao Zhang, Xin Li, Shihao Wang, Kehan Li, Wentong Li, Jun Xiao, Lei Zhang, Beng Chin Ooi

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21786
**Authors:** Qile Su, Shoutai Zhu, Shuai Zhang, Baoyu Liang, Chao Tong

**Abstract:**  Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures, traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for replicating the experiments and annotations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23574
**Authors:** Hongkai Lin, Dingkang Liang, Mingyang Du, Xin Zhou, Xiang Bai

**Abstract:**  Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play- and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of- the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22669
**Authors:** Wenkai Zhu, Xu Li, Qimin Xu, Benwu Wang, Kun Wei, Yiming Peng, Zihang Wang

**Abstract:**  3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23043
**Authors:** Joungbin An, Kristen Grauman

**Abstract:**  Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP) blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

## 9. [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23482
**Authors:** Zujing Liu, Junwen Pan, Qi She, Yuan Gao, Guisong Xia

**Abstract:**  Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22936
**Authors:** Mouxiao Huang, Borui Jiang, Dehua Zheng, Hailin Hu, Kai Han, Xinghao Chen

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding (\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22765
**Authors:** Binxiao Xu, Junyu Feng, Ruichuan An, Yulin Luo, Shilin Yan, Hao Liang, Ming Lu, Wentao Zhang

**Abstract:**  The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22836
**Authors:** Guanyu Yao, Qiucheng Wu, Yang Zhang, Zhaowen Wang, Handong Zhao, Shiyu Chang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities. Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the \textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22335
**Authors:** Xu Zhang, Ruijie Quan, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang

**Abstract:**  Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23007
**Authors:** Youcan Xu, Zhen Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Kexin Li, Feifei Shao, Jun Xiao, Yi Yang, Jun Yu, Long Chen

**Abstract:**  While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation, enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video. CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second, in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video generation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22521
**Authors:** Yang Tian, Fan Liu, Jingyuan Zhang, Wei Bi, Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie

**Abstract:**  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22118
**Authors:** Karim Elmaaroufi, Liheng Lai, Justin Svegliato, Yutong Bai, Sanjit A. Seshia, Matei Zaharia

**Abstract:**  Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work. % or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\% on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21808
**Authors:** Jiaao Yu, Mingjie Han, Jinkun Jiang, Junyu Dong, Tao Gong, Man Lan

**Abstract:**  The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22827
**Authors:** Zahraa Al Sahili, Maryam Fetanat, Maimuna Nowaz, Ioannis Patras, Matthew Purver

**Abstract:**  Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues, lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1]; constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions; unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions. We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes. Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

**Authors:** Tianhui Liu, Hetian Pang, Xin Zhang, Jie Feng, Yong Li, Pan Hui

**Abstract:**  Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem. However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce \textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban \textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators. This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

**Authors:** Zeyu Wang, Zilong Chen, Chenhui Gou, Feng Li, Chaorui Deng, Deyao Zhu, Kunchang Li, Weihao Yu, Haoqin Tu, Haoqi Fan, Cihang Xie

**Abstract:**  Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

**Abstract:**  Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities on existing benchmarks.

**Authors:** Bohan Li, Xin Jin, Hu Zhu, Hongsi Liu, Ruikai Li, Jiazhe Guo, Kaiwen Cai, Chao Ma, Yueming Jin, Hao Zhao, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zeng

**Abstract:**  Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving, enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation. Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark. Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation, and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value in downstream tasks.

## 23. [VOLD: Reasoning Transfer from LLMs to Vision-Language Models via On-Policy Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23497) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23497
**Authors:** Walid Bousselham, Hilde Kuehne, Cordelia Schmid

**Abstract:**  Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23087
**Authors:** Taoyu Wu, Yiyi Miao, Jiaxin Guo, Ziyan Chen, Sihang Zhao, Zhuoxiao Li, Zhe Tang, Baoru Huang, Limin Yu

**Abstract:**  In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most 3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing 3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the 3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to the baseline method.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22706
**Authors:** Hao Li, Zhengyu Zou, Fangfu Liu, Xuanyang Zhang, Fangzhou Hong, Yukang Cao, Yushi Lan, Manyuan Zhang, Gang Yu, Dingwen Zhang, Ziwei Liu

**Abstract:**  Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a 3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data curation pipeline.

## 26. [Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23506) <a id="link26"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23506
**Authors:** Hyeongseop Rha, Jeong Hun Yeo, Yeonju Kim, Yong Man Ro

**Abstract:**  The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23594
**Authors:** Yusu Qian, Cheng Wan, Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Qingyu Zhao, Zhe Gan

**Abstract:**  We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error, models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

## 28. [MergeMix: A Unified Augmentation Paradigm for Visual and Multi-Modal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23479) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23479
**Authors:** Xin Jin, Siyuan Li, Siyong Jian, Kai Yu, Huan Wang

**Abstract:**  Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality. To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs.

**Authors:** Karthikeyan Chandra Sekaran, Markus Geisler, Dominik R\"o{\ss}le, Adithya Mohan, Daniel Cremers, Wolfgang Utschick, Michael Botsch, Werner Huber, Torsten Sch\"on

**Abstract:**  Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions, they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable, limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments. Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection environment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22039
**Authors:** Po-Chen Kuo, Han Hou, Will Dabney, Edgar Y. Walker

**Abstract:**  Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23190
**Authors:** Pascal Benschop, Cristian Meo, Justin Dauwels, Jelte P. Mense

**Abstract:**  The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21793
**Authors:** Usman Ali, Ali Zia, Abdul Rehman, Umer Ramzan, Zohaib Hassan, Talha Sattar, Jing Wang, Wei Xiang

**Abstract:**  Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided, modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings, and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

**Abstract:**  While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today. Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate. Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the series.

**Authors:** Changti Wu, Shijie Lian, Zihao Liu, Lei Zhang, Laurence Tianruo Yang, Kai Chen

**Abstract:**  Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21809
**Authors:** Haru Kondoh, Asako Kanezaki

**Abstract:**  The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models. We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks, demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual navigation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22391
**Authors:** Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Jing Yang, Jian Wang, Chengpei Tang, Keze Wang

**Abstract:**  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR), which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21806
**Authors:** Jiaao Yu, Mingjie Han, Tao Gong, Jian Zhang, Man Lan

**Abstract:**  With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

**Authors:** Fatemeh Nazarieh, Zhenhua Feng, Diptesh Kanojia, Muhammad Awais, Josef Kittler

**Abstract:**  Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation. To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation. MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames. Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy, offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

**Authors:** Sixian Liu, Chen Xu, Qiang Wang, Donghai Shi, Yiwen Li

**Abstract:**  Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in 3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism. Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23532
**Authors:** Anirban Das, Irtaza Khalid, Rafael Pe\~naloza, Steven Schockaert

**Abstract:**  Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning, including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture, and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21850
**Authors:** Gyubeum Lim, Yemo Koo, Vijay Krishna Madisetti

**Abstract:**  Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22009
**Authors:** Yangqin Jiang, Chao Huang

**Abstract:**  With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models (starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks. Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment. Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

## 43. [OFFSIDE: Benchmarking Unlearning Misinformation in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22535) <a id="link43"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22535
**Authors:** Hao Zheng, Zirui Pang, Ling li, Zhijie Deng, Yuhan Pu, Zhaowei Zhu, Xiaobo Xia, Jiaheng Wei

**Abstract:**  Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/zh121800/OFFSIDE}{https://github.com/zh121800/OFFSIDE}.

## 44. [Implicit Modeling for Transferability Estimation of Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23145) <a id="link44"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23145
**Authors:** Yaoyan Zheng, Huiqun Wang, Nan Zhou, Di Huang

**Abstract:**  Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work, we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23306
**Authors:** Jiahao Chang, Chongjie Ye, Yushuang Wu, Yuantao Chen, Yidan Zhang, Zhongjin Luo, Chenghong Li, Yihao Zhi, Xiaoguang Han

**Abstract:**  Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.

**Authors:** Ivan Sipiran, Gustavo Santelices, Lucas Oyarz\'un, Andrea Ranieri, Chiara Romanengo, Silvia Biasotti, Bianca Falcidieno

**Abstract:**  Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples, enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and innovation in point cloud learning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23205
**Authors:** Hoonhee Cho, Jae-Young Kang, Giwon Lee, Hyemin Yang, Heejun Park, Seokwoo Jung, Kuk-Jin Yoon

**Abstract:**  End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

**Abstract:**  Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies. To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374 classes. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct experiments using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks. We release our dataset, model, and code at https://speed1313.github.io/WAON.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22833
**Authors:** Adrian Orenstein, Jessica Chen, Gwyneth Anne Delos Santos, Bayley Sapara, Michael Bowling

**Abstract:**  While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint? If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21781
**Authors:** Runchu Donga, Peng Zhao, Guiqin Wang, Nan Qi, Jie Lin

**Abstract:**  Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates; second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync, an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays. Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22736
**Authors:** Ningli Xu, Rongjun Qin

**Abstract:**  Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution, and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding. Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis, reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising directions for future research. We also include the project page via https://github.com/GDAOSU/Awesome-Cross-View-Methods.

**Authors:** Liling Yang, Ning Chen, Jun Yue, Yidan Liu, Jiayi Ma, Pedram Ghamisi, Antonio Plaza, Leyuan Fang

**Abstract:**  Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks. Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21821
**Authors:** Dirk HR Spennemann

**Abstract:**  This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images. Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair), appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia, moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model evaluation.

**Authors:** Zhaoyang Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Huixue Su, Yufan Zhao, Yifan Wu, Mingyi Deng, Jinyu Xiang, Yizhang Lin, Lingxiao Tang, Yingchao Li, Yuyu Luo, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu

**Abstract:**  Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22697
**Authors:** Vittorio Bernuzzi, Leonardo Rossi, Tomaso Fontanini, Massimo Bertozzi, Andrea Prati

**Abstract:**  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics, encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset (fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery.

**Authors:** Shu-Hao Zhang, Wei-Cheng Tang, Chen Wu, Peng Hu, Nan Li, Liang-Jie Zhang, Qi Zhang, Shao-Qun Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones. TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules, preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98 $\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$ storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models, supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. The model and code can be accessed from Hugging Face and GitHub.

**Authors:** Hongyi Wang, Zhengjie Zhu, Jiabo Ma, Fang Wang, Yue Shi, Bo Luo, Jili Wang, Qiuyu Cai, Xiuming Zhang, Yen-Wei Chen, Lanfen Lin, Hao Chen

**Abstract:**  The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.

**Authors:** Vijay Veerabadran, Fanyi Xiao, Nitin Kamra, Pedro Matias, Joy Chen, Caley Drooff, Brett D Roads, Riley Williams, Ethan Henderson, Xuanyi Zhao, Kevin Carlberg, Joseph Tighe, Karl Ridgeway

**Abstract:**  There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings, featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with 84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant modalities.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23368
**Authors:** Yifan Jiao, Xinran Liu, Xiaoqiong Liu, Xiaohui Yuan, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang

**Abstract:**  Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack

## 60. [Cross-View UAV Geo-Localization with Precision-Focused Efficient Design: A Hierarchical Distillation Approach with Multi-view Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22582) <a id="link60"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22582
**Authors:** Jian Sun, Kangdao Liu, Chi Zhang, Chuangquan Chen, Junge Shen, Chi-Man Vong

**Abstract:**  Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design (PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3 \times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for real-time UAV applications. The project is available at https://github.com/SkyEyeLoc/PFED

## 61. [Modal Aphasia: Can Unified Multimodal Models Describe Images From Memory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21842) <a id="link61"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21842
**Authors:** Michael Aerni, Joshua Swanson, Kristina Nikoli\'c, Florian Tram\`er

**Abstract:**  We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks, as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it explores unified multimodal models and their limitations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21814
**Authors:** Zhuoming Li, Aitong Liu, Mengxi Jia, Tengxiang Zhang, Dell Zhang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

**Authors:** Anna Deichler, Jonas Beskow

**Abstract:**  We introduce Look and Tell, a multimodal dataset for studying referential communication across egocentric and exocentric perspectives. Using Meta Project Aria smart glasses and stationary cameras, we recorded synchronized gaze, speech, and video as 25 participants instructed a partner to identify ingredients in a kitchen. Combined with 3D scene reconstructions, this setup provides a benchmark for evaluating how different spatial representations (2D vs. 3D; ego vs. exo) affect multimodal grounding. The dataset contains 3.67 hours of recordings, including 2,707 richly annotated referential expressions, and is designed to advance the development of embodied agents that can understand and engage in situated dialogue.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22868
**Authors:** Yang Zhang, Qianyu Zhou, Farhad Imani, Jiong Tang

**Abstract:**  Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance. Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed, comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting. Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

**Authors:** Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Hongru Wang, Xinzhe Juan, Yimin Wang, Zelin Zhao, Jiayi Geng, Jiacheng Guo, Peihang Li, Jingzhe Shi, Shilong Liu, Mengdi Wang

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

## 66. [Semantic Surgery: Zero-Shot Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22851) <a id="link66"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22851
**Authors:** Lexiang Xiong, Chengyu Liu, Jingwen Ye, Yan Liu, Yuecong Xu

**Abstract:**  Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

**Authors:** Rishit Dagli, Donglai Xiang, Vismay Modi, Charles Loop, Clement Fuji Tsang, Anka He Chen, Anita Hu, Gavriel State, David I. W. Levin, Maria Shugrina

**Abstract:**  Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in accuracy and speed.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23515
**Authors:** Yaoli Liu, Yao-Xiang Ding, Kun Zhou

**Abstract:**  This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs, no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22107
**Authors:** Bailey Trang, Parham Saremi, Alan Q. Wang, Fangrui Huang, Zahra TehraniNasab, Amar Kumar, Tal Arbel, Li Fei-Fei, Ehsan Adeli

**Abstract:**  Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images. Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

**Authors:** Guangting Zheng, Qinyu Zhao, Tao Yang, Fei Xiao, Zhijie Lin, Jie Wu, Jiajun Deng, Yanyong Zhang, Rui Zhu

**Abstract:**  Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22609
**Authors:** Md. Mehedi Hasan, Rafid Mostafiz, Md. Abir Hossain, Bikash Kumar Paul

**Abstract:**  Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals. Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score, outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial validation.

**Authors:** Eunseop Yoon, Hee Suk Yoon, Jaehyun Jang, SooHwan Eom, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson, Chang D. Yoo

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend. We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

**Authors:** Sima Noorani, Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, Hamed Hassani

**Abstract:**  AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines, shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity, enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts, including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification, regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

**Authors:** Roham Koohestani, Ziyou Li, Anton Podkopaev, Maliheh Izadi

**Abstract:**  This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22010
**Authors:** Or Ronai, Vladimir Kulikov, Tomer Michaeli

**Abstract:**  The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks. Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process. As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free) optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box, enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size. We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23285
**Authors:** Ruoyu Wang, Beier Zhu, Junzhi Li, Liangyu Yuan, Chi Zhang

**Abstract:**  Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23116
**Authors:** Hebaixu Wang, Jing Zhang, Haoyang Chen, Haonan Guo, Di Wang, Jiayi Ma, Bo Du

**Abstract:**  Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

**Authors:** Jing Wang, Jiajun Liang, Jie Liu, Henglin Liu, Gongye Liu, Jun Zheng, Wanyuan Pang, Ao Ma, Zhenyu Xie, Xintao Wang, Meng Wang, Pengfei Wan, Xiaodan Liang

**Abstract:**  Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.

## 79. [SRSR: Enhancing Semantic Accuracy in Real-World Image Super-Resolution with Spatially Re-Focused Text-Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22534) <a id="link79"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22534
**Authors:** Chen Chen, Majid Abdolshah, Violetta Shevchenko, Hongdong Li, Chang Xu, Pulak Purkait

**Abstract:**  Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning, coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution (SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution.

## 80. [Xihe: Scalable Zero-Shot Time Series Learner Via Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21795) <a id="link80"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21795
**Authors:** Yinbo Sun, Yuchen Fang, Zhibo Zhu, Jia Li, Yu Liu, Qiwen Deng, Jun Zhou, Hang Yu, Xingyu Lu, Lintao Ma

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21791
**Authors:** Niraj Chaudhari, Manmeet Singh, Naveen Sudharsan, Amit Kumar Srivastava, Harsh Kamath, Dushyant Mahajan, Ayan Paul

**Abstract:**  Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion quality.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22337
**Authors:** Phillip Mueller, Talip Uenlue, Sebastian Schmidt, Marcel Kollovieh, Jiajie Fan, Stephan Guennemann, Lars Mikelsons

**Abstract:**  Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \& product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various iterative design workflows.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23595
**Authors:** Yixing Chen, Yiding Wang, Siqi Zhu, Haofei Yu, Tao Feng, Muhan Zhan, Mostofa Patwary, Jiaxuan You

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22842
**Authors:** Omri Hirsch, Ron Shapira Weber, Shira Ifergane, Oren Freifeld

**Abstract:**  Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss, that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality, while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22437
**Authors:** G M Shahariar, Ali Nazari, Erfan Shayegani, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However, understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open problem, with many potential important applications including improving training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction, augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states, we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze, interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22213
**Authors:** Yaokun Li, Lihe Ding, Xiao Chen, Guang Tan, Tianfan Xue

**Abstract:**  Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless, existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces, allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce 4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786 animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency.

**Abstract:**  ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria, and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma \le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$, with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy explanations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22675
**Authors:** Jinpeng Dong, Chen Li, Yutong Lin, Jingwen Fu, Sanping Zhou, Nanning Zheng

**Abstract:**  Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23241
**Authors:** Stefan M. Fischer, Johannes Kiechle, Laura Daza, Lina Felsner, Richard Osuala, Daniel M. Lang, Karim Lekadir, Jan C. Peeken, Julia A. Schnabel

**Abstract:**  In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23416
**Authors:** Marco Antonio Ortiz Rincon, Yihui Yang, Christoph Holst

**Abstract:**  This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22605
**Authors:** Yuang Wang, Pengfei Jin, Siyeop Yoon, Matthew Tivnan, Shaoyang Zhang, Li Zhang, Quanzheng Li, Zhiqiang Chen, Dufan Wu

**Abstract:**  Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work, we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score. In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23410
**Authors:** Jiahao Ji, Tianyu Wang, Yeshu Li, Yushen Huo, Zhilin Zhang, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng

**Abstract:**  Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding foundation model in computational advertising.

**Authors:** Xiao Hu, Yuansheng Lian, Ke Zhang, Yunxuan Li, Yuelong Su, Meng Li

**Abstract:**  This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction. The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction, outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score. Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests. Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

**Authors:** Veska Tsenkova, Peter Stanchev, Daniel Petrov, Deyan Lazarov

**Abstract:**  Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes. Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often overlook.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22480
**Authors:** Seonghoon Yu, Dongjun Nam, Dina Katabi, Jeany Son

**Abstract:**  Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss, which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

**Authors:** Guangan Jiang, Tianzi Zhang, Dong Li, Zhenjun Zhao, Haoang Li, Mingrui Li, Hongyu Wang

**Abstract:**  Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences. While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects (e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs). To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while retaining real-time rendering capabilities.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23605
**Authors:** Shuhong Zheng, Ashkan Mirzaei, Igor Gilitschenski

**Abstract:**  Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism, efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation. It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified. Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:**  Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases: Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365 E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

## 99. [Sprint: Sparse-Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21986) <a id="link99"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21986
**Authors:** Dogyun Park, Moayed Haji-Ali, Yanyu Li, Willi Menapace, Sergey Tulyakov, Hyunwoo J. Kim, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Anil Kag

**Abstract:**  Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost, yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

## 100. [AUPO - Abstracted Until Proven Otherwise: A Reward Distribution Based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23214) <a id="link100"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23214
**Authors:** Robin Schm\"ocker, Alexander Dockhorn, Bodo Rosenhahn

**Abstract:**  We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's (MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23240
**Authors:** Carmine Zaccagnino, Fabio Quattrini, Vittorio Pippi, Silvia Cascianelli, Alessio Tonioni, Rita Cucchiara

**Abstract:**  Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.

**Authors:** Gianfranco Basile, Johannes Jakubik, Benedikt Blumenstiel, Thomas Brunschwiler, Juan Bernabe Moreno

**Abstract:**  We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22710
**Authors:** Kaitong Cai, Jusheng Zhang, Yijia Fan, Jing Yang, Keze Wang

**Abstract:**  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore, its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from ``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22626
**Authors:** Adhyayan Veer Singh, Aaron Shen, Brian Law, Ahmed Ismail, Jonas Rohweder, Sean O'Brien, Kevin Zhu

**Abstract:**  Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder. Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10 Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness (pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving accuracy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22436
**Authors:** Ghazal Farhani, Taufiq Rahman, Syed Mostaquim Ali, Andrew Liu, Mohamed Zaki, Dominique Charlebois, Benoit Anctil

**Abstract:**  Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems. Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under varying levels of snowfall

**Authors:** Qiuli Wang, Xiaoming Li, Jie Chen, Yongxu Liu, Xingpeng Zhang, Chen Liu, Wei Chen

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, thereby supporting radiology reporting, trainee education, and quality control. However, systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical contexts remains underexplored. Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized framework for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports is yet to be established. This study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated liver MRI reports by introducing a Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment (MDCA) framework and providing guidance on institution-specific prompt optimization. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate and compare the performance of several advanced LLMs, including Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, DeepSeek-V3, and ByteDance-Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct, using the SiliconFlow platform.

**Authors:** Haochen Zhao, Yuyao Kong, Yongxiu Xu, Gaopeng Gou, Hongbo Xu, Yubin Wang, Haoliang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions. Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22359
**Authors:** Changhao Zhang, Matthew J. Clarkson, Mobarak I. Hoque

**Abstract:**  3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22322
**Authors:** Ali Javidani, Babak Nadjar Araabi, Mohammad Amin Sadeghi

**Abstract:**  This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances. Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/alijavidani/SSL-GraphNNCLR.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23009
**Authors:** Pan Zhao, Hui Yuan, Chongzhen Tian, Tian Guo, Raouf Hamzaoui, Zhigeng Pan

**Abstract:**  Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs; however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement (PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions. UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets: 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29), UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it improved perceptual quality significantly.

## 111. [Attention Residual Fusion Network with Contrast for Source-free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22142) <a id="link111"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22142
**Authors:** Renrong Shao, Wei Zhang, Jun Wang

**Abstract:**  Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network (ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories, which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

**Abstract:**  Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google, High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in a way that makes the most of its strengths.

**Authors:** Amir Mohammad Khadem Hosseini, Sattar Mirzakuchaki

**Abstract:**  Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second (FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.23083
**Authors:** Jan Niklas Groeneveld, Xi Qin, Alexander Schaefer, Yaad Oren

**Abstract:**  Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps. Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4 family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of process rewards and outcome rewards.   Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs. Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.21857
**Authors:** Anthony Zhang, Mahmut Gokmen, Dennis Hein, Rongjun Ge, Wenjun Xia, Ge Wang, Jin Chen

**Abstract:**  The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT). The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.22630
**Authors:** Adinath Dukre, Ankan Deria, Yutong Xie, Imran Razzak

**Abstract:**  Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts, achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.
