## 0. [Spatial CAPTCHA: Generatively Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning for Human-Machine Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03863) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03863
**Authors:** Arina Kharlamova, Bowei He, Chen Ma, Xue Liu

**Abstract:**  Online services rely on CAPTCHAs as a first line of defense against automated abuse, yet recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have eroded the effectiveness of conventional designs that focus on text recognition or 2D image understanding. To address this challenge, we present Spatial CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning, perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0% Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA, which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic tool for spatial reasoning in AI.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 as it introduces a novel benchmark for spatial reasoning and evaluates embodied agents' spatial intelligence.

## 1. [SketchPlan: Diffusion Based Drone Planning From Human Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03545) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03545
**Authors:** Sixten Norelius, Aaron O. Feldman, Mac Schwager

**Abstract:**  We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task completion.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) as it introduces a diffusion-based planner for drone navigation using human sketches.

## 2. [Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03896
**Authors:** Mingyu Liu, Zheng Huang, Xiaoyi Lin, Muzhi Zhu, Canyu Zhao, Zongze Du, Yating Wang, Haoyi Zhu, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen

**Abstract:**  Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) as it introduces a novel framework for bridging vision-language models with physical action modules.

## 3. [Asynchronous Denoising Diffusion Models for Aligning Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04504) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04504
**Authors:** Zijing Hu, Yunze Tong, Fengda Zhang, Junkun Yuan, Jun Xiao, Kun Kuang

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result, during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels, prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions, thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently, these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

## 4. [REAR: Rethinking Visual Autoregressive Models via Generator-Tokenizer Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04450) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04450
**Authors:** Qiyuan He, Yicong Li, Haotian Ye, Jinghao Wang, Xinyao Liao, Pheng-Ann Heng, Stefano Ermon, James Zou, Angela Yao

**Abstract:**  Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models. Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet, it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 as it explores visual autoregressive models and their integration with tokenizers, relevant to image and LLM integration.

## 5. [Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05034) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.05034

**Abstract:**  Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at: https://github.com/yunlong10/Awesome-Video-LMM-Post-Training

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it surveys post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, directly addressing video reasoning and multimodal integration.

## 6. [TRAJECT-Bench:A Trajectory-Aware Benchmark for Evaluating Agentic Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04550) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04550
**Authors:** Pengfei He, Zhenwei Dai, Bing He, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Hanqing Lu, Juanhui Li, Jiayuan Ding, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Suhang Wang, Yue Xing, Jiliang Tang, Benoit Dumoulin

**Abstract:**  Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs, and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth (interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it introduces a new benchmark (TRAJECT-Bench) for evaluating tool use in LLM-based agents, which is relevant to embodied AI.

## 7. [TOPO-Bench: An Open-Source Topological Mapping Evaluation Framework with Quantifiable Perceptual Aliasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04100) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04100
**Authors:** Jiaming Wang, Diwen Liu, Jizhuo Chen, Harold Soh

**Abstract:**  Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in topological mapping.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) as it introduces a new benchmark and evaluation framework for topological mapping.

## 8. [Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04587
**Authors:** Sheng Wang, Ruiming Wu, Charles Herndon, Yihang Liu, Shunsuke Koga, Jeanne Shen, Zhi Huang

**Abstract:**  Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs behavior-guided reasoning.

## 9. [UGround: Towards Unified Visual Grounding with Unrolled Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03853) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03853
**Authors:** Rui Qian, Xin Yin, Chuanhang Deng, Zhiyuan Peng, Jian Xiong, Wei Zhai, Dejing Dou

**Abstract:**  We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04390
**Authors:** Xuehai He, Shijie Zhou, Thivyanth Venkateswaran, Kaizhi Zheng, Ziyu Wan, Achuta Kadambi, Xin Eric Wang

**Abstract:**  World models that support controllable   and editable spatiotemporal environments are valuable   for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and flexible task design. While   recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are constrained to 2D views and offer limited   interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that generates 4D scenes with   multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From   natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces   dynamic environments where objects can be directed,   recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed   from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates   trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits to be applied interactively   without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high scene fidelity while enabling   controllability and editability. The code is available   at https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Morph4D.

**Authors:** Min Woo Sun, Alejandro Lozano, Javier Gamazo Tejero, Vishwesh Nath, Xiao Xiao Sun, James Burgess, Yuhui Zhang, Kun Yuan, Robert Tibshirani, Sean Huver, Serena Yeung-Levy

**Abstract:**  Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

**Authors:** Hanchen Zhang, Xiao Liu, Bowen Lv, Xueqiao Sun, Bohao Jing, Iat Long Iong, Zhenyu Hou, Zehan Qi, Hanyu Lai, Yifan Xu, Rui Lu, Hongning Wang, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions. However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL, trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents. Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04333
**Authors:** Lan Feng, Yang Gao, Eloi Zablocki, Quanyi Li, Wuyang Li, Sichao Liu, Matthieu Cord, Alexandre Alahi

**Abstract:**  Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics, not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning. RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering.

## 14. [Harnessing Synthetic Preference Data for Enhancing Temporal Understanding of Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03955) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03955
**Authors:** Sameep Vani, Shreyas Jena, Maitreya Patel, Chitta Baral, Somak Aditya, Yezhou Yang

**Abstract:**  While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets, leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/sameepv21/timewarp.

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws.

**Authors:** Han Zhang, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, Jose L. Porras, Roger D. Soberanis-Mukul, Hao Ding, Hongchao Shu, Benjamin D. Killeen, Ankita Ghosh, Lonny Yarmus, Masaru Ishii, Angela Christine Argento, Mathias Unberath

**Abstract:**  Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed from every angle.

## 17. [Visual Odometry with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03348) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03348
**Authors:** Vlardimir Yugay, Duy-Kien Nguyen, Theo Gevers, Cees G. M. Snoek, Martin R. Oswald

**Abstract:**  Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04477
**Authors:** Soo Yong Kim, Suin Cho, Vincent-Daniel Yun, Gyeongyeon Hwang

**Abstract:**  Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03608
**Authors:** Ruitao Wu, Yifan Zhao, Guangyao Chen, Jia Li

**Abstract:**  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

**Authors:** Hadi Nekoei, Aman Jaiswal, Patrice Bechard, Oleh Shliazhko, Orlando Marquez Ayala, Mathieu Reymond, Massimo Caccia, Alexandre Drouin, Sarath Chandar, Alexandre Lacoste

**Abstract:**  Large language model (LLM) agents perform well in sequential decision-making tasks, but improving them on unfamiliar domains often requires costly online interactions or fine-tuning on large expert datasets. These strategies are impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories, extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference, a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++, WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03858
**Authors:** Jyoti Kini, Rohit Gupta, Mubarak Shah

**Abstract:**  Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training. Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView, DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach. Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16 mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance, thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in aerial applications.

**Authors:** Jay Zhangjie Wu, Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Tianshi Cao, Kai He, Yifan Lu, Ruiyuan Gao, Enze Xie, Shiyi Lan, Jose M. Alvarez, Jun Gao, Sanja Fidler, Zian Wang, Huan Ling

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04560
**Authors:** Honghao Fu, Yuan Ouyang, Kai-Wei Chang, Yiwei Wang, Zi Huang, Yujun Cai

**Abstract:**  Recent advances demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to adapt to novel vision-language tasks from a few contextual examples. However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that ContextNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, underscoring the promise of agentic workflows for advancing scalable and robust contextualization in multimodal ICL.

**Authors:** Tingting Liao, Chongjian Ge, Guangyi Liu, Hao Li, Yi Zhou

**Abstract:**  Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page: https://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/.

**Authors:** Nonghai Zhang, Zeyu Zhang, Jiazi Wang, Yang Zhao, Hao Tang

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.

**Abstract:**  We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task. Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to: i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii) generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

**Abstract:**  In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

## 28. [Progressive Gaussian Transformer with Anisotropy-aware Sampling for Open Vocabulary Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04759) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04759
**Authors:** Chi Yan, Dan Xu

**Abstract:**  The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be released upon publication on our project page: https://yanchi-3dv.github.io/PG-Occ

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04401
**Authors:** Xuyang Guo, Zekai Huang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores the limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in compositional counting, which is a specific aspect of vision-language integration.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04794
**Authors:** Alon Kaya, Igal Bilik, Inna Stainvas

**Abstract:**  Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs) have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet) with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that, similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that balance local and global representations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04673
**Authors:** Chan Hee Song, Yiwen Song, Palash Goyal, Yu Su, Oriana Riva, Hamid Palangi, Tomas Pfister

**Abstract:**  Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse, ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application. Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely, we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03666
**Authors:** Jiang Wu, Sichao Wu, Yinsong Ma, Guangyuan Yu, Haoyuan Xu, Lifang Zheng, Jingliang Duan

**Abstract:**  Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.

Kather, Fiona R. Kolbinger, Sebastian Bodenstedt, Stefanie Speidel

**Abstract:**  Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

## 34. [Unified Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Matching Cost Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03363) <a id="link34"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03363
**Authors:** Zhe Zhang, Mingxiu Cai, Gaochang Wu, Jing Zhang, Lingqiao Liu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyou Chai, Xiatian Zhu

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based (pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models. Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample, mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD scenarios. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04188
**Authors:** Shikang Zheng, Guantao Chen, Qinming Zhou, Yuqi Lin, Lixuan He, Chang Zou, Peiliang Cai, Jiacheng Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Abstract:**  Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56 times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

**Authors:** Zhuangzhi Gao, Hongyi Qin, He Zhao, Qinkai Yu, Feixiang Zhou, Eduard Shantsila, Uazman Alam, Alena Shantsila, Wahbi El-Bouri, Gregory Y. H. Lip, Yalin Zheng

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold promise for integrating diverse data modalities, but current medical adaptations such as LLaVA-Med often fail to fully exploit the synergy between color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and offer limited interpretability of quantitative biomarkers. We introduce GROK, a grounded multimodal large language model that jointly processes CFP, OCT, and text to deliver clinician-grade diagnoses of ocular and systemic disease. GROK comprises three core modules: Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation, CLIP-Style OCT-Biomarker Alignment, and Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning, which together establish a quantitative-to-qualitative diagnostic chain of thought, mirroring real clinical reasoning when producing detailed lesion annotations. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which covers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic classification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment of the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK outperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and fine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are publicly available in the GROK repository.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04282
**Authors:** Yu Kiu (Idan), Lau, Chao Chen, Ge Jin, Chen Feng

**Abstract:**  Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference, and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to the second-best baseline.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03851
**Authors:** Ruiying Ma, Chieh-Jan Mike Liang, Yanjie Gao, Francis Y. Yan

**Abstract:**  Designing system algorithms remains challenging, where the discontinuous nature of the solution space often forces system engineers to rely on generic heuristics at the expense of performance. We study whether LLMs can practically drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider: cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04315
**Authors:** Jiarui Ouyang, Yihui Wang, Yihang Gao, Yingxue Xu, Shu Yang, Hao Chen

**Abstract:**  Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses. We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling.

**Authors:** Luo Cheng, Song Siyang, Yan Siyuan, Yu Zhen, Ge Zongyuan

**Abstract:**  The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems. Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time, and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this, ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics) into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii) facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters, unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and reaction appropriateness.

**Authors:** Keane Ong, Wei Dai, Carol Li, Dewei Feng, Hengzhi Li, Jingyao Wu, Jiaee Cheong, Rui Mao, Gianmarco Mengaldo, Erik Cambria, Paul Pu Liang

**Abstract:**  Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors, that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the development of unified models for understanding psychological and social behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text, audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior Atlas, we train three models: OmniSapiens-7B SFT, OmniSapiens-7B BAM, and OmniSapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding meaningful performance gains.

## 42. [SSDD: Single-Step Diffusion Decoder for Efficient Image Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04961) <a id="link42"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04961
**Authors:** Th\'eophane Vallaeys, Jakob Verbeek, Matthieu Cord

**Abstract:**  Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models, extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent. However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses, as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from $0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster generative models.

**Authors:** Hyunmin Cho, Donghoon Ahn, Susung Hong, Jee Eun Kim, Seungryong Kim, Kyong Hwan Jin

**Abstract:**  Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03352
**Authors:** Mahdi Farahbakhsh, Vishnu Teja Kunde, Dileep Kalathil, Krishna Narayanan, Jean-Francois Chamberland

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/mhdfb/sideinfo-search-reconstruction}{this repository}.

**Authors:** Minseo Lee, Byeonghyeon Lee, Lucas Yunkyu Lee, Eunsoo Lee, Sangmin Kim, Seunghyeon Song, Joo Chan Lee, Jong Hwan Ko, Jaesik Park, Eunbyung Park

**Abstract:**  4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality.

## 46. [Decoding Emotion in the Deep: A Systematic Study of How LLMs Represent, Retain, and Express Emotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04064) <a id="link46"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04064
**Authors:** Jingxiang Zhang, Lujia Zhong

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the nuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable (they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04781
**Authors:** Javed Ahmad, Federico Dassi\`e, Selene Frascella, Gabriele Marchello, Ferdinando Cannella, Arianna Traviglia

**Abstract:**  High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation. However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods, offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and reduced reliance on expert operators.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04797
**Authors:** Qi Li, Shuwen Qiu, Julien Han, Xingzi Xu, Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu, Kee Kiat Koo, Karim Bouyarmane

**Abstract:**  The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning.   To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04643
**Authors:** Xiangyu Li, Yawen Zeng, Xiaofen Xing, Jin Xu, Xiangmin Xu

**Abstract:**  In this paper, our objective is to develop a multi-agent financial system that incorporates simulated trading, a technique extensively utilized by financial professionals. While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance on ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends. Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years (https://quantagents.github.io/).

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04128
**Authors:** Dmitrii Troitskii, Koyena Pal, Chris Wendler, Callum Stuart McDougall, Neel Nanda

**Abstract:**  Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities. Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04265
**Authors:** Mohsen Hariri, Amirhossein Samandar, Michael Hinczewski, Vipin Chaudhary

**Abstract:**  Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials (samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.

**Authors:** Peichao Lai, Jinhui Zhuang, Kexuan Zhang, Ningchang Xiong, Shengjie Wang, Yanwei Xu, Chong Chen, Yilei Wang, Bin Cui

**Abstract:**  Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale benchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry, our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03689
**Authors:** Zhengyi Liu, Xinrui Wang, Xianyong Fang, Zhengzheng Tu, Linbo Wang

**Abstract:**  RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high- and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03747
**Authors:** Zuomin Qu, Yimao Guo, Qianyue Hu, Wei Lu

**Abstract:**  Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZOMIN28/LoRA-Patching.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04093
**Authors:** Guixian Zhang, Guan Yuan, Ziqi Xu, Yanmei Zhang, Zhenyun Deng, Debo Cheng

**Abstract:**  Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES) aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous, noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs, exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived, semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment. Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

**Authors:** Zongyin Deng, Qing Zhou, Yuhao Fang, Zijian Wang, Yao Lu, Ye Zhang, Chun Li

**Abstract:**  This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference. Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with $N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

**Authors:** Zishang Jiang, Jinyi Han, Tingyun Li, Xinyi Wang, Sihang Jiang, Jiaqing Liang, Zhaoqian Dai, Shuguang Ma, Fei Yu, Yanghua Xiao

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance. Our code is available online.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04474
**Authors:** Gang Li, Yan Chen, Ming Lin, Tianbao Yang

**Abstract:**  Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group, shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a 1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\% performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

**Authors:** Debojyoti Ghosh, Soumya K Ghosh, Adrijit Goswami

**Abstract:**  Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data, enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification, we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2), which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and industrial domains.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.04695
**Authors:** Yiding Wang, Zhepei Wei, Xinyu Zhu, Yu Meng

**Abstract:**  Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality, including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation. Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards, underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.03337
**Authors:** Andrey A. Lebedev, Victor B. Kazantsev, Sergey V. Stasenko

**Abstract:**  This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others. To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

**Abstract:**  Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However, low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1 accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved.

**Authors:** Hao Fang, Zechao Zhan, Weixin Feng, Ziwei Huang, XuBin Li, Tiezheng Ge

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains. However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

**Abstract:**  Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework, combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting, sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

**Abstract:**  Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language that allows AI agents and their workflows to be defined in a way that is compatible across different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI Agent frameworks.   Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and reusability, and reducing redundant development efforts. Additionally, Agent Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations.   Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain access to a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore benefit from the support of other frameworks as well as other tools; (iii) Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability, facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which benefit from faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, as well as greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future developments.
