## 0. [Scaling RL to Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07966
**Authors:** Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Xiaojuan Qi, Sifei Liu, Hongxu Yin, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Abstract:**  We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 6 as it explores long video reasoning in vision-language models (VLLMs) and introduces a new dataset and training pipeline for video QA tasks.

## 1. [Geometry Forcing: Marrying Video Diffusion and 3D Representation for Consistent World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07982) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07982
**Authors:** Haoyu Wu, Diankun Wu, Tianyu He, Junliang Guo, Yang Ye, Yueqi Duan, Jiang Bian

**Abstract:**  Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page: https://GeometryForcing.github.io.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 6 as it proposes Geometry Forcing, a method for improving video diffusion models with 3D consistency, relevant to video understanding.

## 2. [ViLU: Learning Vision-Language Uncertainties for Failure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07620) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07620
**Authors:** Marc Lafon, Yannis Karmim, Julio Silva-Rodriguez, Paul Couairon, Cl\'ement Rambour, Rapha\"el Fournier-Sniehotta, Ismail Ben Ayed, Jose Dolz, Nicolas Thome

**Abstract:**  Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores a novel uncertainty quantification framework (ViLU) for Vision-Language Models, which is relevant to visual and multimodal large language models.

## 3. [Open Source Planning & Control System with Language Agents for Autonomous Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07257) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07257
**Authors:** Licong Xu, Milind Sarkar, Anto I. Lonappan, \'I\~nigo Zubeldia, Pablo Villanueva-Domingo, Santiago Casas, Christian Fidler, Chetana Amancharla, Ujjwal Tiwari, Adrian Bayer, Chadi Ait Ekiou, Miles Cranmer, Adrian Dimitrov, James Fergusson, Kahaan Gandhi, Sven Krippendorf, Andrew Laverick, Julien Lesgourgues, Antony Lewis, Thomas Meier, Blake Sherwin, Kristen Surrao, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Chi Wang, Xueqing Xu, Boris Bolliet

**Abstract:**  We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 as it introduces a multi-agent system for autonomous scientific discovery, which is relevant to embodied/robotic AI.

## 4. [NexViTAD: Few-shot Unsupervised Cross-Domain Defect Detection via Vision Foundation Models and Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07579) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07579
**Authors:** Tianwei Mu, Feiyu Duan, Bo Zhou, Dan Xue, Manhong Huang

**Abstract:**  This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include: (1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect detection.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 4 as it focuses on vision foundation models and their application to cross-domain defect detection.

## 5. [StarDojo: Benchmarking Open-Ended Behaviors of Agentic Multimodal LLMs in Production-Living Simulations with Stardew Valley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07445) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07445
**Authors:** Weihao Tan, Changjiu Jiang, Yu Duan, Mingcong Lei, Jiageng Li, Yitian Hong, Xinrun Wang, Bo An

**Abstract:**  Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 as it introduces a new benchmark (StarDojo) for evaluating multimodal LLMs in production-living simulations.

## 6. [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07125
**Authors:** Cristina Mata, Kanchana Ranasinghe, Michael S. Ryoo

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain. UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 as it integrates domain-agnostic text embeddings with image segmentation, combining image understanding and LLMs.

## 7. [Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07157
**Authors:** Arshak Rezvani, Ali Akbari, Kosar Sanjar Arani, Maryam Mirian, Emad Arasteh, Martin J. McKeown

**Abstract:**  Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 5 as it combines EEG-based image generation with large language models for semantic alignment.

## 8. [One Object, Multiple Lies: A Benchmark for Cross-task Adversarial Attack on Unified Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07709) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07709
**Authors:** Jiale Zhao, Xinyang Jiang, Junyao Gao, Yuhao Xue, Cairong Zhao

**Abstract:**  Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress, enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models, which is relevant to VLLMs and MLLMs.

## 9. [Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner for efficient Video Temporal Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07744) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07744
**Authors:** David Pujol-Perich, Sergio Escalera, Albert Clap\'es

**Abstract:**  Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical, parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST), the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/davidpujol/SDST.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 6 as it focuses on video temporal grounding, a video understanding task, with novel methods and integration of InternVideo2.

## 10. [Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free Acceleration of Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07990) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07990
**Authors:** Jeongseok Hyun, Sukjun Hwang, Su Ho Han, Taeoh Kim, Inwoong Lee, Dongyoon Wee, Joon-Young Lee, Seon Joo Kim, Minho Shim

**Abstract:**  Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 as it proposes a method for spatio-temporal token merging in video large language models.

## 11. [LOSC: LiDAR Open-voc Segmentation Consolidator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07605) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07605
**Authors:** Nermin Samet, Gilles Puy, Renaud Marlet

**Abstract:**  We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically, image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method, called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant margins.

## 12. [Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07796) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07796
**Authors:** Xi Xiao, Yunbei Zhang, Xingjian Li, Tianyang Wang, Xiao Wang, Yuxiang Wei, Jihun Hamm, Min Xu

**Abstract:**  Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts, leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead, ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

## 13. [Entity Re-identification in Visual Storytelling via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07340) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07340
**Authors:** Daniel A. P. Oliveira, David Martins de Matos

**Abstract:**  Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models, struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,   often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the same individuals or objects,   leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.   This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames.   We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences   and stories from unrelated images.   We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior.   We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities   in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts.   Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B).   Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).   Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',   and cross-frame character and object persistence increased   across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).   Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07519
**Authors:** Bangning Wei, Joshua Maraval, Meriem Outtas, Kidiyo Kpalma, Nicolas Ramin, Lu Zhang

**Abstract:**  The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07410
**Authors:** Xinan Zhang, Muhammad Zubair Irshad, Anthony Yezzi, Yi-Chang Tsai, Zsolt Kira

**Abstract:**  We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings, while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07274
**Authors:** Ananya Raval, Aravind Narayanan, Vahid Reza Khazaie, Shaina Raza

**Abstract:**  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source (GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

**Authors:** Haochen Wang, Xiangtai Li, Zilong Huang, Anran Wang, Jiacong Wang, Tao Zhang, Jiani Zheng, Sule Bai, Zijian Kang, Jiashi Feng, Zhuochen Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control, TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60% accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR (Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning, enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07487
**Authors:** Jiaxu Wan, Xu Wang, Mengwei Xie, Xinyuan Chang, Xinran Liu, Zheng Pan, Mu Xu, Ding Yuan

**Abstract:**  Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps, which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer, as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/WallelWan/OMA-MAT.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07610
**Authors:** Siting Wang, Luoyang Sun, Cheng Deng, Kun Shao, Minnan Pei, Zheng Tian, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang

**Abstract:**  Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition, displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

**Authors:** Chengfei Wu, Ronald Seoh, Bingxuan Li, Liqiang Zhang, Fengrong Han, Dan Goldwasser

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07527
**Authors:** Joelle Hanna, Linus Scheibenreif, Damian Borth

**Abstract:**  Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping, wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments. Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is available at https://github.com/HSG-AIML/MAPEX.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07802
**Authors:** Zhihui Zhang, Luanyuan Dai, Qika Lin, Yunfeng Diao, Guangyin Jin, Yufei Guo, Jing Zhang, Xiaoshuai Hao

**Abstract:**  Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations: (1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities, ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting its superior adaptability and reliability.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07574
**Authors:** Enrico Vompa, Tanel Tammet, Mohit Vaishnav

**Abstract:**  Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks. This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control, we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs. However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

**Authors:** Yichen Lu, Wei Dai, Jiaen Liu, Ching Wing Kwok, Zongheng Wu, Xudong Xiao, Ao Sun, Sheng Fu, Jianyuan Zhan, Yian Wang, Takatomo Saito, Sicheng Lai

**Abstract:**  LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge, enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here: https://github.com/pigeonai-org/ViDove

**Authors:** Jinseong Kim, Junghoon Song, Gyeongseon Baek, Byeongjoon Noh

**Abstract:**  We propose \textbf{KeyRe-ID}, a keypoint-guided video-based person re-identification framework consisting of global and local branches that leverage human keypoints for enhanced spatiotemporal representation learning. The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically segments body regions based on keypoints to generate fine-grained, part-aware features. Extensive experiments on MARS and iLIDS-VID benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 91.73\% mAP and 97.32\% Rank-1 accuracy on MARS, and 96.00\% Rank-1 and 100.0\% Rank-5 accuracy on iLIDS-VID.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07381
**Authors:** Hao Xu, Arbind Agrahari Baniya, Sam Wells, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Richard Dazeley, Sunil Aryal

**Abstract:**  Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07831
**Authors:** Yuchen Zhu, Cheng Shi, Dingyou Wang, Jiajin Tang, Zhengxuan Wei, Yu Wu, Guanbin Li, Sibei Yang

**Abstract:**  Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

**Abstract:**  Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16 seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16 seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their architectural designs and performance characteristics.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07747
**Authors:** Charlie Budd, Silv\`ere S\'egaud, Matthew Elliot, Graeme Stasiuk, Yijing Xie, Jonathan Shapey, Tom Vercauteren

**Abstract:**  Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light) mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available after the review process.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07374
**Authors:** Haotian Wang, Aoran Xiao, Xiaoqin Zhang, Meng Yang, Shijian Lu

**Abstract:**  Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection, allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene. This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

## 31. [Not Only Consistency: Enhance Test-Time Adaptation with Spatio-temporal Inconsistency for Remote Physiological Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07908) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07908
**Authors:** Xiao Yang, Yuxuan Fan, Can Liu, Houcheng Su, Weichen Guo, Jiyao Wang, Dengbo He

**Abstract:**  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments, considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based self-supervised \textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration (\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference. Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

## 32. [Single-Step Latent Diffusion for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07878) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07878
**Authors:** Jiayi Wu, Tianfu Wang, Md Abu Bakr Siddique, Md Jahidul Islam, Cornelia Fermuller, Yiannis Aloimonos, Christopher A. Metzler

**Abstract:**  Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast, and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07818
**Authors:** Lu Xu, Jiaqian Yu, Xiongfeng Peng, Yiwei Chen, Weiming Li, Jaewook Yoo, Sunghyun Chunag, Dongwook Lee, Daehyun Ji, Chao Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+ parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by $62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07521
**Authors:** Mingyang Song, Yang Zhang, Marko Mihajlovic, Siyu Tang, Markus Gross, Tun\c{c} Ozan Ayd{\i}n

**Abstract:**  Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

**Authors:** Samuel Reyd, Ada Diaconescu, Jean-Louis Dessalles

**Abstract:**  Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

## 36. [Dual Semantic-Aware Network for Noise Suppressed Ultrasound Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07443) <a id="link36"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07443
**Authors:** Ling Zhou, Runtian Yuan, Yi Liu, Yuejie Zhang, Rui Feng, Shang Gao

**Abstract:**  Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames, effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation, significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some image-based models. Code can be found in \href{https://github.com/ZhouL2001/DSANet}{DSANet}

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07670
**Authors:** Jinhee Kim, Taesung Kim, Taewoo Kim, Dong-Wook Kim, Byungduk Ahn, Yoon-Ji Kim, In-Seok Song, Jaegul Choo

**Abstract:**  In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network, which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback, coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

**Authors:** Minkyung Kim, Junsik Kim, Hwidong Bae, Woongcheol Yang, Sangdon Park, Sohee Bae

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07708
**Authors:** Wei Shang, Dongwei Ren, Wanying Zhang, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu, Wangmeng Zuo

**Abstract:**  Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT).

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07931
**Authors:** Hans Gundlach, Jayson Lynch, Neil Thompson

**Abstract:**  The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies, leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices, we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

## 41. [Stable Preference Optimization for LLMs: A Bilevel Approach Beyond Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07723) <a id="link41"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07723
**Authors:** Chengtao Jian, Kai Yang, Ye Ouyang, Xiaozhou Ye

**Abstract:**  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs, while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and interpretable language model alignment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07638
**Authors:** F. Xavier Gaya-Morey, Julia Sanchez-Perez, Cristina Manresa-Yee, Jose M. Buades-Rubio

**Abstract:**  Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07483
**Authors:** Qiangqiang Wu, Yi Yu, Chenqi Kong, Ziquan Liu, Jia Wan, Haoliang Li, Alex C. Kot, Antoni B. Chan

**Abstract:**  With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

**Authors:** Zhiwei Hu, V\'ictor Guti\'errez-Basulto, Zhiliang Xiang, Ru Li, Jeff Z. Pan

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base. Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components: (i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention, considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07780
**Authors:** M\'elanie Roschewitz, Raghav Mehta, Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro, Ben Glocker

**Abstract:**  We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i) simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data (unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling (instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off, (iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models, yields best calibration results overall.

**Authors:** Marie-Christine Pali, Christina Schwaiger, Malik Galijasevic, Valentin K. Ladenhauf, Stephanie Mangesius, Elke R. Gizewski

**Abstract:**  The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks: a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences, we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI applications.

**ArXiv ID:** 2507.07687
**Authors:** Peixian Zhuang, Yijian Wang, Zhenqi Fu, Hongliang Zhang, Sam Kwong, Chongyi Li

**Abstract:**  Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently, Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark (called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency. Code and dataset will be available at https://wyjgr.github.io/Tree-Mamba.html.

**Abstract:**  Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However, challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

**Authors:** Getamesay Haile Dagnaw, Yanming Zhu, Muhammad Hassan Maqsood, Wencheng Yang, Xingshuai Dong, Xuefei Yin, Alan Wee-Chung Liew

**Abstract:**  Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

**Abstract:**  Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions. While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling. In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER. This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at https://github.com/Cross-Innovation-Lab/AU-DFER.

**Comment:** Does not closely match any specific criterion but is generally relevant to computer vision due to its focus on dynamic facial expression recognition with AU-enhanced modeling.
