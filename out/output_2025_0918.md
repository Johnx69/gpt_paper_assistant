## 0. [Dense Video Understanding with Gated Residual Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14199) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14199
**Authors:** Haichao Zhang, Wenhao Chai, Shwai He, Ang Li, Yun Fu

**Abstract:**  High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 6 as it introduces a novel method (Gated Residual Tokenization) for dense video understanding and proposes a new benchmark (DIVE).

## 1. [Diving into Mitigating Hallucinations from a Vision Perspective for Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13836) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13836
**Authors:** Weihang Wang, Xinhao Li, Ziyue Wang, Yan Pang, Jielei Zhang, Peiyi Li, Qiang Zhang, Longwen Gao

**Abstract:**  Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it focuses on mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and introduces a novel benchmark (VHBench-10) and method (VisionWeaver) for vision-language integration.

## 2. [SAIL-VL2 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14033) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14033
**Authors:** Weijie Yin, Yongjie Ye, Fangxun Shu, Yue Liao, Zijian Kang, Hongyuan Dong, Haiyang Yu, Dingkang Yang, Jiacong Wang, Han Wang, Wenzhuo Liu, Xiao Liang, Shuicheng Yan, Chao Feng

**Abstract:**  We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it introduces a vision-language foundation model (SAIL-VL2) with multimodal reasoning capabilities.

## 3. [Mitigating Query Selection Bias in Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13722) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13722
**Authors:** Dingwei Zhang, Dong Zhang, Jinhui Tang

**Abstract:**  Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in \emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame, while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 6 as it introduces a novel query-based method (Triple Query Former) for Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS), addressing temporal and spatial challenges.
**Relevance:** 9

## 4. [MapAnything: Universal Feed-Forward Metric 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13414) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13414
**Authors:** Nikhil Keetha, Norman M\"uller, Johannes Sch\"onberger, Lorenzo Porzi, Yuchen Zhang, Tobias Fischer, Arno Knapitsch, Duncan Zauss, Ethan Weber, Nelson Antunes, Jonathon Luiten, Manuel Lopez-Antequera, Samuel Rota Bul\`o, Christian Richardt, Deva Ramanan, Sebastian Scherer, Peter Kontschieder

**Abstract:**  We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 as it introduces a universal transformer-based model for 3D reconstruction tasks, which is relevant to embodied/robotic AI.

## 5. [MINGLE: VLMs for Semantically Complex Region Detection in Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13484) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13484
**Authors:** Liu Liu, Alexandra Kudaeva, Marco Cipriano, Fatimeh Al Ghannam, Freya Tan, Gerard de Melo, Andres Sevtsuk

**Abstract:**  Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 as it focuses on using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantically complex region detection in urban scenes.
**Relevance:** 9

## 6. [FishBEV: Distortion-Resilient Bird's Eye View Segmentation with Surround-View Fisheye Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13681) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13681
**Authors:** Hang Li, Dianmo Sheng, Qiankun Dong, Zichun Wang, Zhiwei Xu, Tao Li

**Abstract:**  As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras. However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance. To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention (U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 as it introduces a novel BEV segmentation framework (FishBEV) tailored for fisheye cameras, addressing challenges in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:**  This paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning. We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided.

## 8. [AdaThinkDrive: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13769) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13769
**Authors:** Yuechen Luo, Fang Li, Shaoqing Xu, Zhiyi Lai, Lei Yang, Qimao Chen, Ziang Luo, Zixun Xie, Shengyin Jiang, Jiaxin Liu, Long Chen, Bing Wang, Zhi-xin Yang

**Abstract:**  While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for autonomous driving, addressing reasoning challenges.

## 9. [BEVUDA++: Geometric-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14151) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14151
**Authors:** Rongyu Zhang, Jiaming Liu, Xiaoqi Li, Xiaowei Chi, Dan Wang, Li Du, Yuan Du, Shanghang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Vision-centric Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception holds considerable promise for autonomous driving. Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.

## 10. [White Aggregation and Restoration for Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13907) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13907
**Authors:** Jiyun Im, SuBeen Lee, Miso Lee, Jae-Pil Heo

**Abstract:**  Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

**Comment:** This paper aligns closely with criterion 3, as it introduces a novel method (WARM) for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation, which is relevant to embodied/robotic AI and new methods for underexplored challenges.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13379
**Authors:** Asif Azad, Mohammad Sadat Hossain, MD Sadik Hossain Shanto, M Saifur Rahman, Md Rizwan Pervez

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13676
**Authors:** Xiaobo Yang, Xiaojin Gong

**Abstract:**  Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is driving the integration of diverse AI-powered services into smartphones, transforming how users interact with their devices. To simplify access to predefined AI services, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task instruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on smartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to receive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI tasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions; 2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones, offering a more seamless and efficient experience.

**Authors:** Daiqi Liu, Tom\'as Arias-Vergara, Johannes Enk, Fangxu Xing, Maureen Stone, Jerry L. Prince, Jana Hutter, Andreas Maier, Jonghye Woo, Paula Andrea P\'erez-Toro

**Abstract:**  Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation, we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.

## 16. [Improving Generalized Visual Grounding with Instance-aware Joint Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13747) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13747
**Authors:** Ming Dai, Wenxuan Cheng, Jiang-Jiang Liu, Lingfeng Yang, Zhenhua Feng, Wankou Yang, Jingdong Wang

**Abstract:**  Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/InstanceVG.

**Authors:** Yaru Chen, Ruohao Guo, Liting Gao, Yang Xiang, Qingyu Luo, Zhenbo Li, Wenwu Wang

**Abstract:**  Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible, visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2) a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100 datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple metrics.

**Authors:** Kai Chen, Jin Xiao, Leheng Zhang, Kexuan Shi, Shuhang Gu

**Abstract:**  In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global, regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage, computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

**Abstract:**  Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.

**Authors:** Zhaokai Wang, Penghao Yin, Xiangyu Zhao, Changyao Tian, Yu Qiao, Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Gen Luo

**Abstract:**  Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

**Authors:** Zihao Wang, Muyao Li, Kaichen He, Xiangyu Wang, Zhancun Mu, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang

**Abstract:**  The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy, but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all pretrained model checkpoints at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/OpenHA

**Authors:** Yuan Wei, Xiaohan Shan, Ran Miao, Jianmin Li

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement learning agent development traditionally requires extensive expertise and lengthy iterations, often resulting in high failure rates and limited accessibility. This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive, high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention. $Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$ provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55% performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13939
**Authors:** Gia Khanh Nguyen, Yifeng Huang, Minh Hoai

**Abstract:**  Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

**Authors:** Jiangbei Yue, Shuonan Yang, Tailin Chen, Jianbo Jiao, Zeyu Fu

**Abstract:**  Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

**Authors:** Zongru Wu, Rui Mao, Zhiyuan Tian, Pengzhou Cheng, Tianjie Ju, Zheng Wu, Lingzhong Dong, Haiyue Sheng, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu

**Abstract:**  The advent of multimodal agents facilitates effective interaction within graphical user interface (GUI), especially in ubiquitous GUI control. However, their inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key bottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with binary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents demonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state already matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive the current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and act accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR can improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\%. Further evaluations on three public benchmarks show that StaR also enhances general task performance. Finally, evaluations on a dynamic environment highlight the potential of StaR for real-world applications. Code, benchmark, and StaR-enhanced agents are available at https://github.com/ZrW00/StaR.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14060
**Authors:** Jun Du, Weiwei Xing, Ming Li, Fei Richard Yu

**Abstract:**  Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.

**Authors:** Yujia Lin, Nicholas Evans

**Abstract:**  Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

## 28. [AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14084) <a id="link28"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14084
**Authors:** Jingyi Yuan, Jianxiong Ye, Wenkang Chen, Chenqiang Gao

**Abstract:**  Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore, rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13784
**Authors:** Hanfang Liang, Bing Wang, Shizhen Zhang, Wen Jiang, Yizhuo Yang, Weixiang Guo, Shenghai Yuan

**Abstract:**  Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile, pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window latency and inference latency.

## 31. [DEFT-VTON: Efficient Virtual Try-On with Consistent Generalised H-Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13506) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13506
**Authors:** Xingzi Xu, Qi Li, Shuwen Qiu, Julien Han, Karim Bouyarmane

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods, real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference, serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of 5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).   To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results.

## 32. [Teaching LLMs to Plan: Logical Chain-of-Thought Instruction Tuning for Symbolic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13351) <a id="link32"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13351
**Authors:** Pulkit Verma, Ngoc La, Anthony Favier, Swaroop Mishra, Julie A. Shah

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.

**Authors:** Anand Swaroop, Akshat Nallani, Saksham Uboweja, Adiliia Uzdenova, Michael Nguyen, Kevin Zhu, Sunishchal Dev, Ashwinee Panda, Vasu Sharma, Maheep Chaudhary

**Abstract:**  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving large language model performance on complex tasks, but recent work shows that reasoning steps often fail to causally influence the final answer, creating brittle and untrustworthy outputs. Prior approaches focus primarily on measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between reasoning performance and trustworthiness. We release our code at \href{https://github.com/Anut-py/frit}.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13338
**Authors:** Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Kasra Ranjbarigderi, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi

**Abstract:**  This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

**Abstract:**  Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.   To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.   Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

**Authors:** Konstantinos Voudouris, Andrew Barron, Marta Halina, Colin Klein, Matishalin Patel

**Abstract:**  Transitional accounts of evolution emphasise a few changes that shape what is evolvable, with dramatic consequences for derived lineages. More recently it has been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major transitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks, fundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of information flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether changes in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in cognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and laminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars that differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We documented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent networks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related qualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We also noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of transition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of evolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a performance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform non-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some changes in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance.

**Abstract:**  We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

**Authors:** Chao Shuai, Gaojian Wang, Kun Pan, Tong Wu, Fanli Jin, Haohan Tan, Mengxiang Li, Zhenguang Liu, Feng Lin, Kui Ren

**Abstract:**  While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge. A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the localization.   To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of forgery localization.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13834
**Authors:** Nguyen Lan Vi Vu, Thanh-Huy Nguyen, Thien Nguyen, Daisuke Kihara, Tianyang Wang, Xingjian Li, Min Xu

**Abstract:**  Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in advancing semi-supervised segmentation. Our code is available at https://github.com/vnlvi2k3/Semi-MoE.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13756
**Authors:** Yuqi Yang, Dongliang Chang, Yuanchen Fang, Yi-Zhe SonG, Zhanyu Ma, Jun Guo

**Abstract:**  In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress. However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language, color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13761
**Authors:** Qikai Chang, Zhenrong Zhang, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Yicheng Pan, Jianshu Zhang, Jun Du, Quan Liu, Jianqing Gao

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13662
**Authors:** Yulan Guo, Longguang Wang, Wendong Mao, Xiaoyu Dong, Yingqian Wang, Li Liu, Wei An

**Abstract:**  Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13936
**Authors:** Harvey Mannering, Zhiwu Huang, Adam Prugel-Bennett

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

**Abstract:**  High-quality annotated data is a cornerstone of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP).

A critical gap remains in the holistic process control required to manage these sources dynamically, addressing complex scheduling and quality-cost trade-offs in a unified manner. Inspired by real-world crowdsourcing companies, we introduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process control by integrating task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost management. It implements a novel methodology that rationally assigns tasks, enabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically in a collaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrowdAgent through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal classification tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13357
**Authors:** Yongchao Huang, Hassan Raza

**Abstract:**  We propose semantic fusion, a lightweight scheme that augments a Transformer language model (LM) with a parallel, fuzzy-membership feature channel that encodes token-level semantics. Each token is represented by a vector of interpretable features (e.g. part-of-speech cues, shallow roles, boundary flags, sentiment polarity and strength) whose values are graded degrees from differentiable membership functions (e.g. power kernels). These per-token vectors form a sentence-level semantic matrix fused via a gated adapter into the LM. Training uses standard next-token prediction, an auxiliary loss that reconstructs the semantic features from hidden states, and a lightweight uniformizer that regularizes adjective-class distributions. On a synthetic two-clause corpus with held-out adjectives for out-of-distribution (OOD) control, semantic fusion improves perplexity and enables precise, user-controllable generation of polarity and punctuation while maintaining model simplicity. This approach adds only small overhead, remains fully compatible with tied input-output embeddings, and provides an interpretable pathway for conditioned natural language generation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13482
**Authors:** Hao Xu, Xiaolin Wu, Xi Zhang

**Abstract:**  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance. However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly reducing training time and memory consumption.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14012
**Authors:** Tamara R. Lenhard, Andreas Weinmann, Tobias Koch

**Abstract:**  Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes, their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions. The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades, contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8 percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

**ArXiv ID:** 2509.14149
**Authors:** Haotian Li, Jianbo Jiao

**Abstract:**  Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you still recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria but explores abstract image representations, which may be tangentially interesting for vision tasks.

## 49. [Curvature as a tool for evaluating dimensionality reduction and estimating intrinsic dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13385) <a id="link49"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2509.13385
**Authors:** Charlotte Beylier, Parvaneh Joharinad, J\"urgen Jost, Nahid Torbati

**Abstract:**  Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the metric relations between triples of points and other points. More significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria but discusses dimensionality reduction and intrinsic dimensionality, which is tangentially related to general machine learning.

## 50. [Explicit Reasoning Makes Better Judges: A Systematic Study on Accuracy, Efficiency, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13332) <a id="link50"></a>

**Abstract:**  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to augmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a higher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that thinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of bias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random biases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the multilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends its benefits beyond English. Overall, our work results in several important findings that provide systematic evidence that explicit reasoning offers clear advantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm not only in accuracy and efficiency but also in robustness.
