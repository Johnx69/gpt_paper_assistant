**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18265
**Authors:** Weiyun Wang, Zhangwei Gao, Lixin Gu, Hengjun Pu, Long Cui, Xingguang Wei, Zhaoyang Liu, Linglin Jing, Shenglong Ye, Jie Shao, Zhaokai Wang, Zhe Chen, Hongjie Zhang, Ganlin Yang, Haomin Wang, Qi Wei, Jinhui Yin, Wenhao Li, Erfei Cui, Guanzhou Chen, Zichen Ding, Changyao Tian, Zhenyu Wu, Jingjing Xie, Zehao Li, Bowen Yang, Yuchen Duan, Xuehui Wang, Songze Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Haodong Duan, Nianchen Deng, Bin Fu, Yinan He, Yi Wang, Conghui He, Botian Shi, Junjun He, Yingtong Xiong, Han Lv, Lijun Wu, Wenqi Shao, Kaipeng Zhang, Huipeng Deng, Biqing Qi, Jiaye Ge, Qipeng Guo, Wenwei Zhang, Wanli Ouyang, Limin Wang, Min Dou, Xizhou Zhu, Tong Lu, Dahua Lin, Jifeng Dai, Bowen Zhou, Weijie Su, Kai Chen, Yu Qiao, Wenhai Wang, Gen Luo

**Abstract:**  We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

## 1. [SSG-Dit: A Spatial Signal Guided Framework for Controllable Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17062) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17062
**Authors:** Peng Hu, Yu Gu, Liang Luo, Fuji Ren

**Abstract:**  Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control and overall consistency.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 6. Proposes a novel framework for controllable video generation with spatial signal guidance.

## 2. [SAIL-Recon: Large SfM by Augmenting Scene Regression with Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17972) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17972
**Authors:** Junyuan Deng, Heng Li, Tao Xie, Weiqiang Ren, Qian Zhang, Ping Tan, Xiaoyang Guo

**Abstract:**  Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are publicly available at: https://hkust-sail.github.io/ sail-recon/.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3. Introduces a novel method for large-scale Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with a focus on camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction.

## 3. [Do Multimodal LLMs See Sentiment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16873) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16873
**Authors:** Neemias B. da Silva, John Harrison, Rodrigo Minetto, Myriam R. Delgado, Bogdan T. Nassu, Thiago H. Silva

**Abstract:**  Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it explores sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

## 4. [Hierarchical Contextual Grounding LVLM: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual-Language Understanding with Robust Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16974) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16974
**Authors:** Leilei Guo, Antonio Carlos Rivera, Peiyu Tang, Haoxuan Ren, Zheyu Song

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 as it proposes a novel architecture for fine-grained visual-language understanding in LVLMs.

## 5. [Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning for Efficient VideoLLM Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17686) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17686
**Authors:** Yogesh Kumar

**Abstract:**  Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a 65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it proposes a token pruning method for efficient VideoLLM processing.
**Relevance:** 9
**Novelty:** 7

## 6. [UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17890) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17890
**Authors:** Qipeng Zhu, Yanzhe Chen, Huasong Zhong, Yan Li, Jie Chen, Zhixin Zhang, Junping Zhang, Zhenheng Yang

**Abstract:**  Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization (APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks, such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text, image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and transferable prompt optimization.

**Authors:** Jiaqi Liu, Songning Lai, Pengze Li, Di Yu, Wenjie Zhou, Yiyang Zhou, Peng Xia, Zijun Wang, Xi Chen, Shixiang Tang, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Mingyu Ding, Huaxiu Yao, Aoran Wang

**Abstract:**  Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration (RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws.

## 8. [Instant Preference Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17718) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17718
**Authors:** Yang Li, Songlin Yang, Xiaoxuan Han, Wei Wang, Jing Dong, Yueming Lyu, Ziyu Xue

**Abstract:**  Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16812
**Authors:** Xinhao Xiang, Kuan-Chuan Peng, Suhas Lohit, Michael J. Jones, Jiawei Zhang

**Abstract:**  3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17054
**Authors:** Qingwen Zhang, Xiaomeng Zhu, Yushan Zhang, Yixi Cai, Olov Andersson, Patric Jensfelt

**Abstract:**  Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow ($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a $\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost, regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$ faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model weights.

**Authors:** Xu Sun, Yunqing He, Tongwei Ren, Gangshan Wu

**Abstract:**  In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects. It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.

**Authors:** Anku Rani, Aparna Garimella, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan, Paul Pu Liang

**Abstract:**  Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However, they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts, questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16932
**Authors:** Qi Song, Ziyuan Luo, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See, Renjie Wan

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces. However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned 3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our work is available at: https://github.com/qsong2001/Invert3D.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17364
**Authors:** Guoqing Zhang, Xingtong Ge, Lu Shi, Xin Zhang, Muqing Xue, Wanru Xu, Yigang Cen

**Abstract:**  The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/gavin-gqzhang/UniGen.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18271
**Authors:** Haitang Feng, Jie Liu, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu, Beiqi Chen, Jianhuang Lai, Guangcong Wang

**Abstract:**  3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.

**Authors:** Meiqi Gong, Hao Zhang, Xunpeng Yi, Linfeng Tang, Jiayi Ma

**Abstract:**  Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19 employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is released at https://github.com/Meiqi-Gong/TemCoCo.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18179
**Authors:** Zhenwei Tang, Difan Jiao, Blair Yang, Ashton Anderson

**Abstract:**  Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17726
**Authors:** Koichiro Kamide, Shunsuke Sakai, Shun Maeda, Chunzhi Gu, Chao Zhang

**Abstract:**  Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings, regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18067
**Authors:** Kaiyu Li, Xiangyong Cao, Ruixun Liu, Shihong Wang, Zixuan Jiang, Zhi Wang, Deyu Meng

**Abstract:**  Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp, a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images, where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and open-world Earth observation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17417
**Authors:** Xiaojie Yin, Qilong Wang, Qinghua Hu

**Abstract:**  Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components: Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model, effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts. Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

**Authors:** Yanbing Bai, Rui-Yang Ju, Lemeng Zhao, Junjie Hu, Jianchao Bi, Erick Mas, Shunichi Koshimura

**Abstract:**  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage 1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1 method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage 1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage 2 compared to baseline methods.

**Authors:** Xinning Yao, Bo Liu, Bojian Li, Jingjing Wang, Jinghua Yue, Fugen Zhou

**Abstract:**  Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for augmented reality and navigation systems.

**Abstract:**  Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable quality assessment in AM applications.

**Abstract:**  We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games, PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination of control, planning, and high-level insight.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17524
**Authors:** Xingxin He, Aurora Rofena, Ruimin Feng, Haozhe Liao, Zhaoye Zhou, Albert Jang, Fang Liu

**Abstract:**  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting. While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

**Authors:** Fucai Ke, Joy Hsu, Zhixi Cai, Zixian Ma, Xin Zheng, Xindi Wu, Sukai Huang, Weiqing Wang, Pari Delir Haghighi, Gholamreza Haffari, Ranjay Krishna, Jiajun Wu, Hamid Rezatofighi

**Abstract:**  Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.

## 27. [See What You Need: Query-Aware Visual Intelligence through Reasoning-Perception Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17932) <a id="link27"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17932
**Authors:** Zixuan Dong, Baoyun Peng, Yufei Wang, Lin Liu, Xinxin Dong, Yunlong Cao, Xiaodong Wang

**Abstract:**  Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However, current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames; (2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3) confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA (76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video understanding.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18242
**Authors:** Fadi Khatib, Dror Moran, Guy Trostianetsky, Yoni Kasten, Meirav Galun, Ronen Basri

**Abstract:**  We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing 3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel scenes without additional training.

## 29. [EventTracer: Fast Path Tracing-based Event Stream Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18071) <a id="link29"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18071
**Authors:** Zhenyang Li, Xiaoyang Bai, Jinfan Lu, Pengfei Shen, Edmund Y. Lam, Yifan Peng

**Abstract:**  Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300 FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous driving, and VRAR.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17280
**Authors:** Ruichao Hou, Boyue Xu, Tongwei Ren, Gangshan Wu

**Abstract:**  The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching real-time speed.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16884
**Authors:** Yi Zhang, Lingxiao Wei, Bowei Zhang, Ziwei Liu, Kai Yi, Shu Hu

**Abstract:**  Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17971
**Authors:** Pu Feng, Size Wang, Yuhong Cao, Junkang Liang, Rongye Shi, Wenjun Wu

**Abstract:**  The development and application of large language models (LLM) have demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework, LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16881
**Authors:** Xilai Li, Huichun Liu, Xiaosong Li, Tao Ye, Zhenyu Kuang, Huafeng Li

**Abstract:**  Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response, we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions, designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this, the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues, thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Feecuin/AWM-Fuse.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16972
**Authors:** Minghao Zhou, Rafael Souza, Yaqian Hu, Luming Che

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics, Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC), to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17825
**Authors:** Bingkang Shi, Jen-tse Huang, Guoyi Li, Xiaodan Zhang, Zhongjiang Yao

**Abstract:**  Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes. FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content, covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$ score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content, suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics. These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications. Our code and data are available at anonymous GitHub https://github.com/Anonymous999-xxx/FairGamer .

**Authors:** Liane Makatura, Benjamin Jones, Siyuan Bian, Wojciech Matusik

**Abstract:**  Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions. (i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000 parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17658
**Authors:** Yaolei Qi, Yikai Yang, Wenbo Peng, Shumei Miao, Yutao Hu, Guanyu Yang

**Abstract:**  Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/YaoleiQi/PCCAC.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17404
**Authors:** Haoyu Wang, Hao Tang, Donglin Di, Zhilu Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, Feng Gao, Siwei Ma, Shiliang Zhang

**Abstract:**  Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion. Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos, limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic and structurally coherent human videos.

In this paper, we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE), which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks, namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent personality estimation, demonstrating the effectiveness of in-domain self-supervised pre-training.

**Authors:** Xin Wang, Zhiyao Cui, Hao Li, Ya Zeng, Chenxu Wang, Ruiqi Song, Yihang Chen, Kun Shao, Qiaosheng Zhang, Jinzhuo Liu, Siyue Ren, Shuyue Hu, Zhen Wang

**Abstract:**  Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios. Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive, understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17427
**Authors:** Zhao Zheng, Jingfan Fan, Long Shao, Hong Song, Danni Ai, Tianyu Fu, Deqiang Xiao, Yongtian Wang, Jian Yang

**Abstract:**  Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems. Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis. Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the number of points, even in the worst case.

**Abstract:**  We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA) on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models (LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning, and cross-lingual generalization.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17846
**Authors:** Yang Chen, Yanbin Wei, Ke Jin, Yi Kong, James Kwok, Yu Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing (LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization. This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However, we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning. Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL, consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning. Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17282
**Authors:** Xin Zhang, Jiaming Chu, Jian Zhao, Yuchu Jiang, Xu Yang, Lei Jin, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+ lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset, which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the "Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2: Audio-Visual Detection and Localization (DDL-AV), and won first place in this competition.

**Abstract:**  Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning, facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions, we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a 6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models, compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code, trained models, and synthetic dataset at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/RoentGen-v2 .

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16742
**Authors:** Abdul Rehman Akbar, Usama Sajjad, Ziyu Su, Wencheng Li, Fei Xing, Jimmy Ruiz, Wei Chen, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi

**Abstract:**  Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA) patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

**Authors:** Liang Feng, Shikang Zheng, Jiacheng Liu, Yuqi Lin, Qinming Zhou, Peiliang Cai, Xinyu Wang, Junjie Chen, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18095
**Authors:** Zhicong Tang, Tiankai Hang, Shuyang Gu, Dong Chen, Baining Guo

**Abstract:**  This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM), Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future research on generative models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17488
**Authors:** Zhiwen Chen, Jinjian Wu, Zhiyu Zhu, Yifan Zhang, Guangming Shi, Junhui Hou

**Abstract:**  This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction, both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework, which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

**Authors:** Muhammad Aqeel, Shakiba Sharifi, Marco Cristani, Francesco Setti

**Abstract:**  Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and 92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect data curation is challenging.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17221
**Authors:** Sopam Dasgupta, Sadaf MD Halim, Joaqu\'in Arias, Elmer Salazar, Gopal Gupta

**Abstract:**  Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained. Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17614
**Authors:** Aowen Wang, Wei Li, Hao Luo, Mengxing Ao, Chenyu Zhu, Xinyang Li, Fan Wang

**Abstract:**  Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

**Authors:** Anindya Mondal, Ayan Banerjee, Sauradip Nag, Josep Llad\'os, Xiatian Zhu, Anjan Dutta

**Abstract:**  Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings. We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation, where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score of 0.97.

## 55. [Camera Pose Refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17876) <a id="link55"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17876
**Authors:** Lulu Hao, Lipu Zhou, Zhenzhong Wei, Xu Wang

**Abstract:**  Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks, requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing 3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches, achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16917
**Authors:** Qing Zhang, Jinguang Tong, Jie Hong, Jing Zhang, Xuesong Li

**Abstract:**  Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts, achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without retraining or weight modification.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17816
**Authors:** Xingyu Ai, Shaoyu Wang, Zhiyuan Jia, Ao Xu, Hongming Shan, Jianhua Ma, Qiegen Liu

**Abstract:**  During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy. Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino, a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging.

**Authors:** Manuel Barusco, Francesco Borsatti, Nicola Beda, Davide Dalle Pezze, Gian Antonio Susto

**Abstract:**  Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention, even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data, Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

**Authors:** Siqing Yuan, Yulin Wang, Zirui Cao, Yueyan Wang, Zehao Weng, Hui Wang, Lei Xu, Zixian Chen, Lei Chen, Zhong Xue, Dinggang Shen

**Abstract:**  Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols, holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI: 0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

## 61. [Quantifying Sycophancy as Deviations from Bayesian Rationality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16846) <a id="link61"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16846
**Authors:** Katherine Atwell, Pedram Heydari, Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani

**Abstract:**  Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2) probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to sycophancy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17408
**Authors:** Bin Huang, Zhong Liu, Huiying Wen, Bingsheng Huang, Xin Chen, Shuo Li

**Abstract:**  Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

**Abstract:**  Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy, surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost. Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs), and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets. EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code, pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at https://github.com/riadhassan/EDLDNet .

## 64. [Few-shot Unknown Class Discovery of Hyperspectral Images with Prototype Learning and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18075) <a id="link64"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18075
**Authors:** Chun Liu, Chen Zhang, Zhuo Li, Zheng Li, Wei Yang

**Abstract:**  Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples. They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes. Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17975
**Authors:** Md Shahi Amran Hossain, Abu Shad Ahammed, Sayeri Mukherjee, Roman Obermaisser

**Abstract:**  The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However, challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17849
**Authors:** Jingyi Liao, Xun Xu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Lile Cai

**Abstract:**  Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation. Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling, so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17188
**Authors:** Zhilin Zhang, Xiang Zhang, Jiaqi Wei, Yiwei Xu, Chenyu You

**Abstract:**  Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work, we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences. While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2) Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4) Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

## 68. [Dual Orthogonal Guidance for Robust Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17017) <a id="link68"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17017
**Authors:** Konstantina Nikolaidou, George Retsinas, Giorgos Sfikas, Silvia Cascianelli, Rita Cucchiara, Marcus Liwicki

**Abstract:**  Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales, DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and challenging writing styles.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18236
**Authors:** Yiming Tang, Arash Lagzian, Srinivas Anumasa, Qiran Zou, Trang Nguyen, Ehsan Adeli, Ching-Yu Cheng, Yilun Du, Dianbo Liu

**Abstract:**  While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs, LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI applications.

**Authors:** Neeraj Matiyali, Siddharth Srivastava, Gaurav Sharma

**Abstract:**  We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images. Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality, better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference. Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques and their impact on stylization performance.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17431
**Authors:** Po-Hsien Yu, Yu-Syuan Tseng, Shao-Yi Chien

**Abstract:**  Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components. First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\% communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34, while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16887
**Authors:** Shunyu Yao, Ming Liu, Zhilu Zhang, Zhaolin Wan, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai, Wangmeng Zuo

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17959
**Authors:** Vedant Khandelwal, Francesca Rossi, Keerthiram Murugesan, Erik Miehling, Murray Campbell, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Lior Horesh

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17843
**Authors:** Weiqi Yan, Lvhai Chen, Shengchuan Zhang, Yan Zhang, Liujuan Cao

**Abstract:**  The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection (ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.16863
**Authors:** Tangyuan Zhang, Shangyu Chen, Qixiang Chen, Jianfei Cai

**Abstract:**  Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc, training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score, SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject customizations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17082
**Authors:** Pedro Silva, Guilherme A. L. Silva, Pablo Coelho, Vander Freitas, Gladston Moreira, David Menotii, Eduardo Luz

**Abstract:**  Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast, proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss, offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification, demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding optimization, with potential for broader applications.

**Authors:** Muhammad Aqeel, Danijel Skocaj, Marco Cristani, Francesco Setti

**Abstract:**  Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

**Authors:** Bingxi Zhao, Lin Geng Foo, Ping Hu, Christian Theobalt, Hossein Rahmani, Jun Liu

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods, tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics. We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths, suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning frameworks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.18186
**Authors:** Le Zhang, Fuping Wu, Arun Thirunavukarasu, Kevin Bronik, Thomas Nichols, Bartlomiej W. Papiez

**Abstract:**  Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts. In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target) and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets: Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is small compared to the given dense annotations.

**Authors:** Xiao Zhang, Changfang Chen, Tianyi Wang

**Abstract:**  The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17894
**Authors:** Iason Ioannis Panagos, Giorgos Sfikas, Christophoros Nikou

**Abstract:**  Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words, these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network backbone.

## 84. [M^3-GloDets: Multi-Region and Multi-Scale Analysis of Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerular Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17666) <a id="link84"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17666

**Abstract:**  Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of accurate classification and robust segmentation.   To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical workflows in the digital pathology domain.

## 85. [TinySR: Pruning Diffusion for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17434) <a id="link85"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2508.17434
**Authors:** Linwei Dong, Qingnan Fan, Yuhang Yu, Qi Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Yawei Luo, Changqing Zou

**Abstract:**  Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR, a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv. We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83% parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high quality results.
