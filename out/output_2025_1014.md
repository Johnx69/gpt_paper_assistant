## 0. [InternSVG: Towards Unified SVG Tasks with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11341) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11341
**Authors:** Haomin Wang, Jinhui Yin, Qi Wei, Wenguang Zeng, Lixin Gu, Shenglong Ye, Zhangwei Gao, Yaohui Wang, Yanting Zhang, Yuanqi Li, Yanwen Guo, Wenhai Wang, Kai Chen, Yu Qiao, Hongjie Zhang

**Abstract:**  General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG tasks, leveraging multimodal reasoning for understanding, editing, and generation.

## 1. [UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10575) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10575
**Authors:** Zhengrong Yue, Haiyu Zhang, Xiangyu Zeng, Boyu Chen, Chenting Wang, Shaobin Zhuang, Lu Dong, KunPeng Du, Yi Wang, Limin Wang, Yali Wang

**Abstract:**  Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7 widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks, but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without guidance), respectively.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 4 and 5 as it introduces UniFlow, a unified tokenizer for visual understanding and generation, addressing both semantic and pixel-level tasks.

## 2. [Situat3DChange: Situated 3D Change Understanding Dataset for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11509) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11509
**Authors:** Ruiping Liu, Junwei Zheng, Yufan Chen, Zirui Wang, Kunyu Peng, Kailun Yang, Jiaming Zhang, Marc Pollefeys, Rainer Stiefelhagen

**Abstract:**  Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages 11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 3 and 5 as it introduces Situat3DChange, a dataset for multimodal large language models in dynamic 3D scene understanding, and proposes a novel 3D MLLM approach.

## 3. [ODI-Bench: Can MLLMs Understand Immersive Omnidirectional Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11549) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11549
**Authors:** Liu Yang, Huiyu Duan, Ran Tao, Juntao Cheng, Sijing Wu, Yunhao Li, Jing Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai

**Abstract:**  Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20 representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces ODI-Bench, a benchmark for MLLMs in omnidirectional image understanding, and explores multimodal reasoning with visual and textual cues.

**Abstract:**  While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.

**Authors:** Yicheng Xu, Yue Wu, Jiashuo Yu, Ziang Yan, Tianxiang Jiang, Yinan He, Qingsong Zhao, Kai Chen, Yu Qiao, Limin Wang, Manabu Okumura, Yi Wang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11687
**Authors:** Jinyu Zhang, Haitao Lin, Jiashu Hou, Xiangyang Xue, Yanwei Fu

**Abstract:**  Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10434
**Authors:** Kangjian Zhu, Haobo Jiang, Yigong Zhang, Jianjun Qian, Jian Yang, Jin Xie

**Abstract:**  We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses, thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks (DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

**Authors:** Dwip Dalal, Gautam Vashishtha, Utkarsh Mishra, Jeonghwan Kim, Madhav Kanda, Hyeonjeong Ha, Svetlana Lazebnik, Heng Ji, Unnat Jain

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

**Authors:** Hongxiang Li, Yaowei Li, Bin Lin, Yuwei Niu, Yuhang Yang, Xiaoshuang Huang, Jiayin Cai, Xiaolong Jiang, Yao Hu, Long Chen

**Abstract:**  Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at \href{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}.

**Authors:** Wentao Wang, Heqing Zou, Tianze Luo, Rui Huang, Yutian Zhao, Zhuochen Wang, Hansheng Zhang, Chengwei Qin, Yan Wang, Lin Zhao, Huaijian Zhang

**Abstract:**  Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset. Code, model, and data will be released.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10426
**Authors:** Suyang Xi, Chenxi Yang, Hong Ding, Yiqing Ni, Catherine C. Liu, Yunhao Liu, Chengqi Zhang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors, but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.

## 13. [Towards Self-Refinement of Vision-Language Models with Triangular Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10487) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10487
**Authors:** Yunlong Deng, Guangyi Chen, Tianpei Gu, Lingjing Kong, Yan Li, Zeyu Tang, Kun Zhang

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle, any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/dengyl20/SRF-LLaVA-1.5.

**Authors:** Zeteng Lin, Xingxing Li, Wen You, Xiaoyang Li, Zehan Lu, Yujun Cai, Jing Tang

**Abstract:**  Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning, thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on 3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models, introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question answering (QA) scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11190
**Authors:** Shengming Yuan, Xinyu Lyu, Shuailong Wang, Beitao Chen, Jingkuan Song, Lianli Gao

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10117
**Authors:** Yunxiang Mo, Tianshi Zheng, Qing Zong, Jiayu Liu, Baixuan Xu, Yauwai Yim, Chunkit Chan, Jiaxin Bai, Yangqiu Song

**Abstract:**  Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic, multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a "storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners" choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct, role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance, particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning, a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10156
**Authors:** Benjia Zhou, Bin Fu, Pei Cheng, Yanru Wang, Jiayuan Fan, Tao Chen

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

**Authors:** Ruohao Li, Hongjun Liu, Leyi Zhao, Zisu Li, Jiawei Li, Jiajun Jiang, Linning Xu, Chen Zhao, Mingming Fan, Chen Liang

**Abstract:**  Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles, Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism, supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines, improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10973
**Authors:** Sanchit Sinha, Oana Frunza, Kashif Rasul, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Aidong Zhang

**Abstract:**  The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

**Abstract:**  We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D geometric prediction tasks.

This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map, depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining the efficiency of feed-forward inference.

**Authors:** Valerie Chen, Rohit Malhotra, Xingyao Wang, Juan Michelini, Xuhui Zhou, Aditya Bharat Soni, Hoang H. Tran, Calvin Smith, Ameet Talwalkar, Graham Neubig

**Abstract:**  LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains, they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands, collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance (e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and identify opportunities for better agent designs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10742
**Authors:** Yuan Xu, Zimu Zhang, Xiaoxuan Ma, Wentao Zhu, Yu Qiao, Yizhou Wang

**Abstract:**  Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

## 23. [Action-Dynamics Modeling and Cross-Temporal Interaction for Online Action Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10682) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10682
**Authors:** Xinyu Yang, Zheheng Jiang, Feixiang Zhou, Yihang Zhu, Na Lv, Nan Xing, Huiyu Zhou

**Abstract:**  Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover, in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset -- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation for future action understanding research.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11512
**Authors:** Jianhao Yuan, Fabio Pizzati, Francesco Pinto, Lars Kunze, Ivan Laptev, Paul Newman, Philip Torr, Daniele De Martini

**Abstract:**  Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11096
**Authors:** Fengling Zhu, Boshi Liu, Jingyu Hua, Sheng Zhong

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks.   In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.   Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.

## 26. [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867) <a id="link26"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09867
**Authors:** Zhi Chen, Xin Yu, Xiaohui Tao, Yan Li, Zi Huang

**Abstract:**  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction. Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11012
**Authors:** Sanchit Sinha, Guangzhi Xiong, Aidong Zhang

**Abstract:**  Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image. Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11092
**Authors:** Bozhou Zhang, Nan Song, Jingyu Li, Xiatian Zhu, Jiankang Deng, Li Zhang

**Abstract:**  End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11144
**Authors:** Gautier Dagan, Frank Keller, Alex Lascarides

**Abstract:**  An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10111
**Authors:** Rui Chen, Bin Liu, Changtao Miao, Xinghao Wang, Yi Li, Tao Gong, Qi Chu, Nenghai Yu

**Abstract:**  Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10292
**Authors:** Joy Hsu, Emily Jin, Jiajun Wu, Niloy J. Mitra

**Abstract:**  Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11017
**Authors:** Runyang Feng, Hyung Jin Chang, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Boeun Kim, Yi Chang, Yixing Gao

**Abstract:**  Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

**Abstract:**  Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users. Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

**Abstract:**  In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved generalization over single-modality approaches.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11296
**Authors:** Lin Zhu, Yifeng Yang, Xinbing Wang, Qinying Gu, Nanyang Ye

**Abstract:**  Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11173
**Authors:** Zhenyu Lu, Liupeng Li, Jinpeng Wang, Yan Feng, Bin Chen, Ke Chen, Yaowei Wang

**Abstract:**  Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text, which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation. Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation. Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

**Authors:** Jinjin Cao, Zhiyang Chen, Zijun Wang, Liyuan Ma, Weijian Luo, Guojun Qi

**Abstract:**  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

**Authors:** Kaitao Chen, Shaohao Rui, Yankai Jiang, Jiamin Wu, Qihao Zheng, Chunfeng Song, Xiaosong Wang, Mu Zhou, Mianxin Liu

**Abstract:**  Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues. In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising 1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the "think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

**Authors:** Aniket Gupta, Hanhui Wang, Charles Saunders, Aruni RoyChowdhury, Hanumant Singh, Huaizu Jiang

**Abstract:**  Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in \textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10287
**Authors:** Markus K\"appeler, \"Ozg\"un \c{C}i\c{c}ek, Daniele Cattaneo, Claudius Gl\"aser, Yakov Miron, Abhinav Valada

**Abstract:**  Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11647
**Authors:** Yinan Chen, Jiangning Zhang, Teng Hu, Yuxiang Zeng, Zhucun Xue, Qingdong He, Chengjie Wang, Yong Liu, Xiaobin Hu, Shuicheng Yan

**Abstract:**  Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity, integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11605
**Authors:** Leonard Bruns, Axel Barroso-Laguna, Tommaso Cavallari, \'Aron Monszpart, Sowmya Munukutla, Victor Adrian Prisacariu, Eric Brachmann

**Abstract:**  Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10663
**Authors:** Gaojian Wang, Feng Lin, Tong Wu, Zhisheng Yan, Kui Ren

**Abstract:**  With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on https://fsfm-3c.github.io/fsvfm.html.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10417
**Authors:** Zhao-Yang Wang, Zhimin Shao, Jieneng Chen, Rama Chellappa

**Abstract:**  Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments. Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances (up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10406
**Authors:** Zhao-Yang Wang, Jieneng Chen, Jiang Liu, Yuxiang Guo, Rama Chellappa

**Abstract:**  Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10160
**Authors:** Zhenjie Mao, Yuhuan Yang, Chaofan Ma, Dongsheng Jiang, Jiangchao Yao, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang

**Abstract:**  Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

## 48. [Class Prototypes based Contrastive Learning for Classifying Multi-Label and Fine-Grained Educational Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11204) <a id="link48"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11204
**Authors:** Rohit Gupta, Anirban Roy, Claire Christensen, Sujeong Kim, Sarah Gerard, Madeline Cincebeaux, Ajay Divakaran, Todd Grindal, Mubarak Shah

**Abstract:**  The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names' vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rohit-gupta/MMContrast/tree/main/APPROVE

**Abstract:**  This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting, etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10587
**Authors:** Jingchao Wang, Wenlong Zhang, Dingjiang Huang, Hong Wang, Yefeng Zheng

**Abstract:**  Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities, there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration, linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding, called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/FSVG.

**Abstract:**  With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

**Authors:** Chunyu Xie, Bin Wang, Fanjing Kong, Jincheng Li, Dawei Liang, Ji Ao, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin

**Abstract:**  Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

**Authors:** Zhaofang Qian, Hardy Chen, Zeyu Wang, Li Zhang, Zijun Wang, Xiaoke Huang, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Zeyu Zheng, Haoqin Tu, Cihang Xie, Yuyin Zhou

**Abstract:**  Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches 34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases, achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10113
**Authors:** Yuxi Mi, Qiuyang Yuan, Zhizhou Zhong, Xuan Zhao, Jiaogen Zhou, Fubao Zhu, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou

**Abstract:**  In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion, intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture. Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets, containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment. Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust immersive recognition.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10534
**Authors:** Binyu Zhao, Wei Zhang, Zhaonian Zou

**Abstract:**  Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The journal preprint version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11106
**Authors:** Ans Munir, Faisal Z. Qureshi, Mohsen Ali, Muhammad Haris Khan

**Abstract:**  Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example, ``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

## 57. [Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11346) <a id="link57"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11346
**Authors:** Joshua Niemeijer, Jan Ehrhardt, Heinz Handels, Hristina Uzunova

**Abstract:**  Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.   This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.

## 58. [Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117) <a id="link58"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11117
**Authors:** Yaqi Zhao, Xiaochen Wang, Li Dong, Wentao Zhang, Yuhui Yuan

**Abstract:**  Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.

## 59. [Multi Camera Connected Vision System with Multi View Analytics: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09731) <a id="link59"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09731
**Authors:** Muhammad Munsif, Waqas Ahmad, Amjid Ali, Mohib Ullah, Adnan Hussain, Sung Wook Baik

**Abstract:**  Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.

## 60. [Beyond AlphaEarth: Toward Human-Centered Spatial Representation via POI-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09894) <a id="link60"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09894
**Authors:** Junyuan Liu, Quan Qin, Guangsheng Dong, Xinglei Wang, Jiazhuang Feng, Zichao Zeng, Tao Cheng

**Abstract:**  General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10194
**Authors:** Feng Xiao, Hongbin Xu, Hai Ci, Wenxiong Kang

**Abstract:**  Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10365
**Authors:** Linlian Jiang, Rui Ma, Li Gu, Ziqiang Wang, Xinxin Zuo, Yang Wang

**Abstract:**  Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However, existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.

## 63. [MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10478) <a id="link63"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10478
**Authors:** Deng Li, Jun Shao, Bohao Xing, Rong Gao, Bihan Wen, Heikki K\"alvi\"ainen, Xin Liu

**Abstract:**  Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently, Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models (SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition, previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba (MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely, MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10679
**Authors:** Yuxiang Luo, Qing Xu, Hai Huang, Yuqi Ouyang, Zhen Chen, Wenting Duan

**Abstract:**  Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions. While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09782
**Authors:** Yufa Zhou, Yixiao Wang, Xunjian Yin, Shuyan Zhou, Anru R. Zhang

**Abstract:**  We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

**Authors:** Zhongsheng Wang, Ming Lin, Zhedong Lin, Yaser Shakib, Qian Liu, Jiamou Liu

**Abstract:**  Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters, enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and animation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10931
**Authors:** SHengjie Ma, Chenlong Deng, Jiaxin Mao, Jiadeng Huang, Teng Wang, Junjie Wu, Changwang Zhang, Jun wang

**Abstract:**  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where answers are only weakly supported by cited content.   To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.   Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning.

**Authors:** Xinbang Dai, Huikang Hu, Yongrui Chen, Jiaqi Li, Rihui Jin, Yuyang Zhang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Guilin Qi

**Abstract:**  While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI) research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic papers.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11194
**Authors:** Peiming Li, Zhiyuan Hu, Yang Tang, Shiyu Li, Xi Chen

**Abstract:**  Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences (including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000 preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10649
**Authors:** Can Xie, Ruotong Pan, Xiangyu Wu, Yunfei Zhang, Jiayi Fu, Tingting Gao, Guorui Zhou

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse. To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

**Authors:** Sheng Jin, Haoming Wang, Zhiqi Gao, Yongbo Yang, Bao Chunjia, Chengliang Wang

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

## 72. [On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10456) <a id="link72"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10456
**Authors:** Tai Le-Gia, Ahn Jaehyun

**Abstract:**  Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data. Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies -- similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.'' CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation, yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across architectures.

**Abstract:**  We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

**Authors:** Chengqian Gao, Haonan Li, Taylor W. Killian, Jianshu She, Renxi Wang, Liqun Ma, Zhoujun Cheng, Shibo Hao, Zhiqiang Xu

**Abstract:**  Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance, often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy, performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem. As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii) truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

**Abstract:**  We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

**Authors:** Yang Hou, Minggu Wang, Jianjun Zhao

**Abstract:**  Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

**Authors:** Bo Peng, Zichuan Wang, Sheng Yu, Xiaochuan Jin, Wei Wang, Jing Dong

**Abstract:**  Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and other related areas.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10269
**Authors:** Donglin Huang, Yongyuan Li, Tianhang Liu, Junming Huang, Xiaoda Yang, Chi Wang, Weiwei Xu

**Abstract:**  Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11613
**Authors:** Feng Zhang, Haoyou Deng, Zhiqiang Li, Lida Li, Bin Xu, Qingbo Lu, Zisheng Cao, Minchen Wei, Changxin Gao, Nong Sang, Xiang Bai

**Abstract:**  Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

## 80. [Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100) <a id="link80"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10100
**Authors:** Kuangpu Guo, Lijun Sheng, Yongcan Yu, Jian Liang, Zilei Wang, Ran He

**Abstract:**  Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/krumpguo/FedCoPL}{https://github.com/krumpguo/FedCoPL}.

## 81. [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171) <a id="link81"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11171
**Authors:** Junfei Shi, Haojia Zhang, Haiyan Jin, Junhuai Li, Xiaogang Song, Yuanfan Guo, Haonan Su, Weisi Lin

**Abstract:**  Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

## 82. [Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848) <a id="link82"></a>

**Authors:** Peixian Liang, Yifan Ding, Yizhe Zhang, Jianxu Chen, Hao Zheng, Hongxiao Wang, Yejia Zhang, Guangyu Meng, Tim Weninger, Michael Niemier, X. Sharon Hu, Danny Z Chen

**Abstract:**  State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.

**Authors:** Yiting Lu, Fengbin Guan, Yixin Gao, Yan Zhong, Xinge Peng, Jiakang Yuan, Yihao Liu, Bo Zhang, Xin Li, Zhibo Chen, Weisi Lin

**Abstract:**  Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training, using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

**Authors:** Geon Yeong Park, Inhwa Han, Serin Yang, Yeobin Hong, Seongmin Jeong, Heechan Jeon, Myeongjin Goh, Sung Won Yi, Jin Nam, Jong Chul Ye

**Abstract:**  The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing. DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization, color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11091
**Authors:** Xianlin Liu, Yan Gong, Bohao Li, Jiajing Huang, Bowen Du, Junchen Ye, Liyan Xu

**Abstract:**  With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11704
**Authors:** Sarah Harkins Dayton, Hayden Everett, Ioannis Schizas, David L. Boothe Jr., Vasileios Maroulas

**Abstract:**  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically, it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for more efficient and robust image classification.

## 87. [Tracing the Traces: Latent Temporal Signals for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10494) <a id="link87"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10494
**Authors:** Martina G. Vilas, Safoora Yousefi, Besmira Nushi, Eric Horvitz, Vidhisha Balachandran

**Abstract:**  Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the overall change in latent representations between the start and end of reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average. Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

**Abstract:**  Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently, a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs), introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

## 89. [SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193) <a id="link89"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.10193
**Authors:** Qingni Wang, Yue Fan, Xin Eric Wang

**Abstract:**  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11223
**Authors:** Masoumeh Chapariniya, Pierre Vuillecard, Jean-Marc Odobez, Volker Dellwo, Teodora Vukovic

**Abstract:**  This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09903
**Authors:** Lenny Aharon, Keemin Lee, Karan Sikka, Selmaan Chettih, Cole Hurwitz, Liam Paninski, Matthew R Whiteway

**Abstract:**  Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.11143
**Authors:** Chuke Chen, Biao Luo, Nan Li, Boxiang Wang, Hang Yang, Jing Guo, Ming Xu

**Abstract:**  The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context, Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model (R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.09996
**Authors:** Lishen Qu, Zhihao Liu, Shihao Zhou, Yaqi Luo, Jie Liang, Hui Zeng, Lei Zhang, Jufeng Yang

**Abstract:**  Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting. These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity, area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker removal.
