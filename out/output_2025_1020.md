## 0. [OmniVinci: Enhancing Architecture and Data for Omni-Modal Understanding LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15870) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15870
**Authors:** Hanrong Ye, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Arushi Goel, Wei Huang, Ligeng Zhu, Yuanhang Su, Sean Lin, An-Chieh Cheng, Zhen Wan, Jinchuan Tian, Yuming Lou, Dong Yang, Zhijian Liu, Yukang Chen, Ambrish Dantrey, Ehsan Jahangiri, Sreyan Ghosh, Daguang Xu, Ehsan Hosseini-Asl, Danial Mohseni Taheri, Vidya Murali, Sifei Liu, Jason Lu, Oluwatobi Olabiyi, Frank Wang, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao, Song Han, Jan Kautz, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov

**Abstract:**  Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces a multimodal LLM with novel architecture and data curation strategies for vision, audio, and text integration.

## 1. [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15018
**Authors:** Mingxuan Liu, Honglin He, Elisa Ricci, Wayne Wu, Bolei Zhou

**Abstract:**  Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3. Introduces a new benchmark and simulation system for urban embodied AI agents, addressing scalability and realism.

## 2. [XModBench: Benchmarking Cross-Modal Capabilities and Consistency in Omni-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15148) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15148
**Authors:** Xingrui Wang, Jiang Liu, Chao Huang, Xiaodong Yu, Ze Wang, Ximeng Sun, Jialian Wu, Alan Yuille, Emad Barsoum, Zicheng Liu

**Abstract:**  Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces a benchmark for evaluating cross-modal capabilities in Omni-Language Models, focusing on vision, audio, and text integration.

## 3. [Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15050) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15050
**Authors:** Chao Huang, Zeliang Zhang, Jiang Liu, Ximeng Sun, Jialian Wu, Xiaodong Yu, Ze Wang, Chenliang Xu, Emad Barsoum, Zicheng Liu

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts. Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some (e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment. DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it proposes a lightweight method for improving reasoning in multimodal large language models.

## 4. [Train a Unified Multimodal Data Quality Classifier with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15162) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15162
**Authors:** Weizhi Wang, Rongmei Lin, Shiyang Li, Colin Lockard, Ritesh Sarkhel, Sanket Lokegaonkar, Jingbo Shang, Xifeng Yan, Nasser Zalmout, Xian Li

**Abstract:**  The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores multimodal large language models and their training strategies.

## 5. [SaLon3R: Structure-aware Long-term Generalizable 3D Reconstruction from Unposed Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15072) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15072
**Authors:** Jiaxin Guo, Tongfan Guan, Wenzhen Dong, Wenzhao Zheng, Wenting Wang, Yue Wang, Yeung Yam, Yun-Hui Liu

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable, on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction. To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90% redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

## 6. [Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15841
**Authors:** Jiayi Lin, Jiabo Huang, Shaogang Gong

**Abstract:**  Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., , and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1. Proposes a neuro-symbolic approach for spatial reasoning in segmentation, which aligns with spatial intelligence for embodied agents.

## 7. [Generalized Dynamics Generation towards Scannable Physical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15041) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15041
**Authors:** Yichen Li, Zhiyi Li, Brandon Feng, Dinghuai Zhang, Antonio Torralba

**Abstract:**  Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors, covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich scenarios.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3. Introduces a novel framework for creating interactive virtual environments with complex physical dynamics, which is relevant to embodied/robotic AI.

## 8. [Unimedvl: Unifying Medical Multimodal Understanding And Generation Through Observation-Knowledge-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15710) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15710

**Abstract:**  Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations, segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/uni-medical/UniMedVL.

## 9. [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15026
**Authors:** Mattia Segu, Marta Tintore Gazulla, Yongqin Xian, Luc Van Gool, Federico Tombari

**Abstract:**  Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy. Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 4 as it focuses on efficient foundation models for instance segmentation, with novel methods for scaling down models for mobile and edge devices.

**Abstract:**  Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto, on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing.

**Abstract:**  We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together, these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to $424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining parameter efficiency.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15385
**Authors:** Haisheng Su, Junjie Zhang, Feixiang Song, Sanping Zhou, Wei Wu, Nanning Zheng, Junchi Yan

**Abstract:**  Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

**Authors:** Minglei Shi, Haolin Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Ziyang Yuan, Xiaoshi Wu, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Abstract:**  Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

**Authors:** Leela Krishna, Mengyang Zhao, Saicharithreddy Pasula, Harshit Rajgarhia, Abhishek Mukherji

**Abstract:**  Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii) consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human validation.   The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata, our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance.

**Abstract:**  Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current 3D VLEs.   In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain, we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain competitive for semantic segmentation.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15194
**Authors:** Tianchen Zhao, Xuanbai Chen, Zhihua Li, Jun Fang, Dongsheng An, Xiang Xu, Zhuowen Tu, Yifan Xing

**Abstract:**  Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and long-tail settings, respectively.

**Abstract:**  Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents, and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains such as webpages.

**Authors:** Huining Yuan, Zelai Xu, Zheyue Tan, Xiangmin Yi, Mo Guang, Kaiwen Long, Haojia Hui, Boxun Li, Xinlei Chen, Bo Zhao, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Chao Yu, Yu Wang

**Abstract:**  Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7% performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

**Authors:** Jie-Ying Lee, Yi-Ruei Liu, Shr-Ruei Tsai, Wei-Cheng Chang, Chung-Ho Wu, Jiewen Chan, Zhenjun Zhao, Chieh Hubert Lin, Yu-Lun Liu

**Abstract:**  Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

**Authors:** Heeseong Shin, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han, Seungryong Kim, Taekyung Kim

**Abstract:**  While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

**Authors:** Do Xuan Long, Xingchen Wan, Hootan Nakhost, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister, Sercan \"O. Ar{\i}k

**Abstract:**  Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15725
**Authors:** Tingyu Lin, Armin Dadras, Florian Kleber, Robert Sablatnig

**Abstract:**  Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary, high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise, missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at https://github.com/linty5/DGME-T.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15060
**Authors:** Frangil Ramirez, Elizabeth Clerkin, David J. Crandall, Linda B. Smith

**Abstract:**  Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given. Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure, with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly, offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds of learners.

**Authors:** Kaushitha Silva, Mansitha Eashwara, Sanduni Ubayasiri, Ruwan Tennakoon, Damayanthi Herath

**Abstract:**  The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features, grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15015
**Authors:** Mor Ventura, Michael Toker, Or Patashnik, Yonatan Belinkov, Roi Reichart

**Abstract:**  Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15296
**Authors:** Yiming Lin, Shang Wang, Junkai Zhou, Qiufeng Wang, Xiao-Bo Jin, Kaizhu Huang

**Abstract:**  Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity, lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations. To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision.

**Abstract:**  Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).

**Authors:** Junliang Ye, Shenghao Xie, Ruowen Zhao, Zhengyi Wang, Hongyu Yan, Wenqiang Zu, Lei Ma, Jun Zhu

**Abstract:**  3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming, animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient, inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000 high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the development of feed-forward 3D editing models.

Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/HiHiAllen/Imaginarium.

**Abstract:**  Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry, material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods, particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15800
**Authors:** Guangzhao He, Yuxi Xiao, Zhen Xu, Xiaowei Zhou, Sida Peng

**Abstract:**  Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges, we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach (i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

**Authors:** Shr-Ruei Tsai, Wei-Cheng Chang, Jie-Ying Lee, Chih-Hai Su, Yu-Lun Liu

**Abstract:**  Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

## 33. [Towards Flash Thinking via Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15374) <a id="link33"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15374
**Authors:** Zezhong Tan, Hang Gao, Xinhong Ma, Feng Zhang, Ziqiang Dong

**Abstract:**  Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

**Authors:** Boyin Liu, Zhuo Zhang, Sen Huang, Lipeng Xie, Qingxu Fu, Haoran Chen, LI YU, Tianyi Hu, Zhaoyang Liu, Bolin Ding, Dongbin Zhao

**Abstract:**  However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15386
**Authors:** Ting-Yu Yen, Yu-Sheng Chiu, Shih-Hsuan Hung, Peter Wonka, Hung-Kuo Chu

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality, real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures. Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy. PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

**Authors:** Zhen Sun, Lei Tan, Yunhang Shen, Chengmao Cai, Xing Sun, Pingyang Dai, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji

**Abstract:**  Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb, infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex scenarios.

**Authors:** Mohammad Soltaninezhad, Yashar Rouzbahani, Jhonatan Contreras, Rohan Chippalkatti, Daniel Kwaku Abankwa, Christian Eggeling, Thomas Bocklitz

**Abstract:**  Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED), addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in microscopy workflows.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15096
**Authors:** Alana Renda, Jillian Ross, Michael Cafarella, Jacob Andreas

**Abstract:**  Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

## 39. [Rethinking Efficient Hierarchical Mixing Architecture for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15497) <a id="link39"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15497
**Authors:** Xianmin Chen, Peiliang Huang, Longfei Han, Dingwen Zhang, Junwei Han

**Abstract:**  Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15749
**Authors:** Haoran Wang, Bo Zhao, Jinghui Wang, Hanzhang Wang, Huan Yang, Wei Ji, Hao Liu, Xinyan Xiao

**Abstract:**  In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA, a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation. Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results. Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15547
**Authors:** Usman Ali, Ali Zia, Waqas Ali, Umer Ramzan, Abdul Rehman, Muhammad Tayyab Chaudhry, Wei Xiang

**Abstract:**  Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.

**Authors:** Yi Wan, Jiuqi Wang, Liam Li, Jinsong Liu, Ruihao Zhu, Zheqing Zhu

**Abstract:**  Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability. PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15304
**Authors:** Fei Wang, Li Shen, Liang Ding, Chao Xue, Ye Liu, Changxing Ding

**Abstract:**  Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning. However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2) incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer. Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model retains 83% of its original average accuracy.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15783
**Authors:** Haowei Zhu, Tianxiang Pan, Rui Qin, Jun-Hai Yong, Bin Wang

**Abstract:**  The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions. However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

**Authors:** Bingyu Li, Feiyu Wang, Da Zhang, Zhiyuan Zhao, Junyu Gao, Xuelong Li

**Abstract:**  Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

**Authors:** Philip DiGiacomo, Haoyang Wang, Jinrui Fang, Yan Leng, W Michael Brode, Ying Ding

**Abstract:**  As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.15434
**Authors:** Huan Chen, Ting Han, Siyu Chen, Zhihao Guo, Yiping Chen, Meiliu Wu

**Abstract:**  Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000 accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.
