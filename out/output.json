        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19117v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory requirements by up to $3\\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.18946v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD) that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D, RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19488v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation: (1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street\" priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits, leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19848v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity, offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others; linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects. To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy, which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic coverage.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19433v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement.

This formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training, UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%.

However, processing long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few seconds.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19513v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19388v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing. Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6 parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera. Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation, making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow, the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches 0.37$\\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance, respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.",

Using this benchmark, we quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs, revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error types.

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.",

Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.",

Traditional motion synthesis methods are either restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view, multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution for category-agnostic 3D animation.

However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance.

Current research lacks reliable datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object interactions.

Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities. Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT) measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework - MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC: 0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively.

Existing approaches can be roughly categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments, computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space. This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.",

However, joint evolution across heterogeneous agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities. Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller open-source models.",

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4$\\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4$\\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to dense attention inference.",

However, existing solutions face several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes (storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images. We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible human-scene interaction from a single image scene.

To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation across timesteps according to guidance needs.

These approaches do not explicitly account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling. Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG. Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a given image \\textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing multimodal learning.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions, add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid). As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution. Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.",

While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable, full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context. Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.",

Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge, dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic segmentation tasks.",

Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.",

Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges, including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies. We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and noise-robust techniques.

This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos, while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills, particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness, highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and patient outcomes in emergency medicine.",

The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain, spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual information within the image.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19439v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19533v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks, causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR) systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1) detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network, where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat) with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19087v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge. Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size, sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily, context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19474v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT) designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost. A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.",

Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly influences the tribe's performance.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.18939v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models. However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However, directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without extensive retraining or fine-tuning.",

Unlike traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn dialogues.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.19500v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution, resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator. As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph (TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct, ToolLLM, {\\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B, and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of 49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture. Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of 2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models (Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain orchestration.",

High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps.
