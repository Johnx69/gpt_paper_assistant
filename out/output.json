        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10128v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10575v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI. Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR, T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.",

Current detection methods often rely on computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands. Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA), instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence, enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world applications.

Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods, which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting. Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore, we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's capabilities.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm, offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10890v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts, yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper, we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing, multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of AI-assisted graphic design.

While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.",

To mirror real-life scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities, we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.",

We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10816v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception, we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF, leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object pose estimation. We will release our code and model.",

However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10452v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer), and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10981v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis (NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However, existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.",

Logical relational reasoning is important for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1) Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3) Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models' self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their initial solutions.

Earlier methods rely on dense BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper, we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split, DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.",

To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.

Leveraging a meticulously assembled benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in forensic workflows.

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10334v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10978v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.",

Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.",

This raises a compelling question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks, leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.",

For example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the 29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely spurious reward signals.",

Existing deep learning approaches often utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion. Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/FSATFusion.",

However, as a critical component of advanced human cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.",

Adapting these models to new populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective, we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, and expand access to medical care.",

Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization and poor computational efficiency.   In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and achieves up to a 10$\\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.",

In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for Deepfake detection.

The SE block allows the network to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse Fake Face Dataset.

        "title": "Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Intermediate Feature Distance",
        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10459v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack performance even under defense strategies.",

        "abstract": "arXiv:2506.10420v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.",
