## 0. [VTimeCoT: Thinking by Drawing for Video Temporal Grounding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14672) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14672
**Authors:** Jinglei Zhang, Yuanfan Guo, Rolandos Alexandros Potamias, Jiankang Deng, Hang Xu, Chao Ma

**Abstract:**  In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project page: https://vtimecot.github.io

## 1. [MathCanvas: Intrinsic Visual Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14958) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14958
**Authors:** Weikang Shi, Aldrich Yu, Rongyao Fang, Houxing Ren, Ke Wang, Aojun Zhou, Changyao Tian, Xinyu Fu, Yuxuan Hu, Zimu Lu, Linjiang Huang, Si Liu, Rui Liu, Hongsheng Li

**Abstract:**  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/

## 2. [ChangingGrounding: 3D Visual Grounding in Changing Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14965) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14965
**Authors:** Miao Hu, Zhiwei Huang, Tai Wang, Jiangmiao Pang, Dahua Lin, Nanning Zheng, Runsen Xu

**Abstract:**  Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding (3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that 3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point, we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target, and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications. Project page: https://hm123450.github.io/CGB/ .

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it introduces a new benchmark for 3D visual grounding in changing scenes, focusing on memory-driven approaches.

## 3. [Terra: Explorable Native 3D World Model with Point Latents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14977) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14977
**Authors:** Yuanhui Huang, Weiliang Chen, Wenzhao Zheng, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu

**Abstract:**  World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 as it introduces a native 3D world model for embodied AI with novel 3D latent space representation.

## 4. [ScaleWeaver: Weaving Efficient Controllable T2I Generation with Multi-Scale Reference Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14882) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14882
**Authors:** Keli Liu, Zhendong Wang, Wengang Zhou, Shaodong Xu, Ruixiao Dong, Houqiang Li

**Abstract:**  Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency. While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 as it introduces a novel framework for controllable text-to-image generation, integrating image understanding and generation tasks.

## 5. [OmniMotion: Multimodal Motion Generation with Continuous Masked Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14954) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14954
**Authors:** Zhe Li, Weihao Yuan, Weichao Shen, Siyu Zhu, Zilong Dong, Chang Xu

**Abstract:**  Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges: creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer, where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization, we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance. The code of our method will be made public.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it integrates multi-modal inputs like text, speech, and music for motion generation.

## 6. [Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing, Retrieval and Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14605) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14605
**Authors:** Yuyang Hong, Jiaqi Gu, Qi Yang, Lubin Fan, Yue Wu, Ying Wang, Kun Ding, Shiming Xiang, Jieping Ye

**Abstract:**  Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/cqu-student/Wiki-PRF

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores knowledge-based visual question answering with multimodal processing and retrieval.

## 7. [You May Speak Freely: Improving the Fine-Grained Visual Recognition Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models with Answer Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14885) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14885
**Authors:** Logan Lawrence, Oindrila Saha, Megan Wei, Chen Sun, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn

**Abstract:**  Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores improvements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for fine-grained visual recognition.

## 8. [TOUCH: Text-guided Controllable Generation of Free-Form Hand-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14874) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14874
**Authors:** Guangyi Han, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha

**Abstract:**  Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent. Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities. The project page is $\href{https://guangyid.github.io/hoi123touch}{here}$.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 and 3 closely. The paper introduces a novel method for generating diverse and physically plausible hand-object interactions, which is relevant to spatial intelligence and embodied agents. It also provides a new benchmark dataset (WildO2) for evaluating these interactions.

## 9. [ImagerySearch: Adaptive Test-Time Search for Video Generation Beyond Semantic Dependency Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14847) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14847
**Authors:** Meiqi Wu, Jiashu Zhu, Xiaokun Feng, Chubin Chen, Chen Zhu, Bingze Song, Fangyuan Mao, Jiahong Wu, Xiangxiang Chu, Kaiqi Huang

**Abstract:**  Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 6 as it proposes a novel test-time search strategy for video generation in imaginative scenarios, advancing video understanding.

## 10. [Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14255
**Authors:** Liao Shen, Wentao Jiang, Yiran Zhu, Tiezheng Ge, Zhiguo Cao, Bo Zheng

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

## 11. [Consistent text-to-image generation via scene de-contextualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14553) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14553
**Authors:** Song Tang, Peihao Gong, Kunyu Li, Kai Guo, Boyu Wang, Mao Ye, Jianwei Zhang, Xiatian Zhu

**Abstract:**  Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14945
**Authors:** JoungBin Lee, Jaewoo Jung, Jisang Han, Takuya Narihira, Kazumi Fukuda, Junyoung Seo, Sunghwan Hong, Yuki Mitsufuji, Seungryong Kim

**Abstract:**  We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14630
**Authors:** Ming Gui, Johannes Schusterbauer, Timy Phan, Felix Krause, Josh Susskind, Miguel Angel Bautista, Bj\"orn Ommer

**Abstract:**  We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective. This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.

## 15. [Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14819
**Authors:** Ji Cao, Yu Wang, Tongya Zheng, Zujie Ren, Canghong Jin, Gang Chen, Mingli Song

**Abstract:**  Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14406
**Authors:** Xikai Zhang, Bo Wang, Likang Xiao, Yongzhi Li, Quan Chen, Wenju Wu, Liu Liu

**Abstract:**  Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single, compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14176
**Authors:** Roger Creus Castanyer, Faisal Mohamed, Pablo Samuel Castro, Cyrus Neary, Glen Berseth

**Abstract:**  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.

**Abstract:**  We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video generation into virtual production.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14387
**Authors:** Yijie Hu, Zihao Zhou, Kaizhu Huang, Xiaowei Huang, Qiufeng Wang

**Abstract:**  Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs), where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However, most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning? Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However, they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance. Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace. IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.13993
**Authors:** Jia Yun Chua, Argyrios Zolotas, Miguel Arana-Catania

**Abstract:**  Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14588
**Authors:** Zhifei Chen, Tianshuo Xu, Leyi Wu, Luozhou Wang, Dongyu Yan, Zihan You, Wenting Luo, Guo Zhang, Yingcong Chen

**Abstract:**  Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

**Abstract:**  Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond mere observation to actively understand, anticipate, and proactively respond to unfolding events. Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where, given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse, evolving questions at the opportune moment, while maintaining synchronized perception and reasoning.

To evaluate and address these properties, we first introduce ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) alongside the ESTP-F1 metric-a novel framework designed for their rigorous assessment. Secondly, we propose a comprehensive technical pipeline to enable models to tackle this challenging task. This pipeline comprises: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique. Our proposed model effectively addresses these critical properties while outperforming multiple baselines across diverse online and offline benchmarks.

**Abstract:**  Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling (EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity, requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

**Abstract:**  In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant, demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

**Abstract:**  A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14112
**Authors:** Huiliang Zhang, Di Wu, Arnaud Zinflou, Benoit Boulet

**Abstract:**  Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals, improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Through comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers fast inference speeds.

**Authors:** Zhe Wu, Hongjin Lu, Junliang Xing, Changhao Zhang, Yin Zhu, Yuhao Yang, Yuheng Jing, Kai Li, Kun Shao, Jianye Hao, Jun Wang, Yuanchun Shi

**Abstract:**  Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based (AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones, showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

**Authors:** Hengyuan Xu, Wei Cheng, Peng Xing, Yixiao Fang, Shuhan Wu, Rui Wang, Xianfang Zeng, Daxin Jiang, Gang Yu, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Abstract:**  Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we (1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2) introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.

## 30. [ColorBench: Benchmarking Mobile Agents with Graph-Structured Framework for Complex Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14621) <a id="link30"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14621
**Authors:** Yuanyi Song, Heyuan Huang, Qiqiang Lin, Yin Zhao, Xiangmou Qu, Jun Wang, Xingyu Lou, Weiwen Liu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Jun Wang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang, Zhaoxiang Wang

**Abstract:**  The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However, real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental results. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/MadeAgents/ColorBench.

## 31. [Towards Generalist Intelligence in Dentistry: Vision Foundation Models for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14532) <a id="link31"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14532
**Authors:** Xinrui Huang, Fan Xiao, Dongming He, Anqi Gao, Dandan Li, Xiaofan Zhang, Shaoting Zhang, Xudong Wang

**Abstract:**  Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

**Abstract:**  With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5. MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14976
**Authors:** Shaowei Liu, Chuan Guo, Bing Zhou, Jian Wang

**Abstract:**  Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14253
**Authors:** Wangtao Sun, Xiang Cheng, Jialin Fan, Yao Xu, Xing Yu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Abstract:**  We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14962
**Authors:** Thao Nguyen, Jiaqi Ma, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Souhaib Ben Taieb, Salman Khan

**Abstract:**  Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14025
**Authors:** Junjie Nan, Jianing Li, Wei Chen, Mingkun Zhang, Xueqi Cheng

**Abstract:**  Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However, non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14668
**Authors:** Md. Abdur Rahman, Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan, Sami Azam, Asif Karim, Jemima Beissbarth, Amanda Leach

**Abstract:**  Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain, where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

**Abstract:**  Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14913
**Authors:** Kyle Montgomery, Sijun Tan, Yuqi Chen, Siyuan Zhuang, Tianjun Zhang, Raluca Ada Popa, Chenguang Wang

**Abstract:**  Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a "free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/wang-research-lab/verification.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14169
**Authors:** Praphul Singh, Corey Barrett, Sumana Srivasta, Amitabh Saikia, Irfan Bulu, Sri Gadde, Krishnaram Kenthapadi

**Abstract:**  Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability, and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning), producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient, reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders (Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14661
**Authors:** Weikang Yu, Vincent Nwazelibe, Xianping Ma, Xiaokang Zhang, Richard Gloaguen, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Pedram Ghamisi

**Abstract:**  Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations. Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

**Authors:** Emanuele Marconato, Samuele Bortolotti, Emile van Krieken, Paolo Morettin, Elena Umili, Antonio Vergari, Efthymia Tsamoura, Andrea Passerini, Stefano Teso

**Abstract:**  Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.

**Authors:** Qi Chen, Xinze Zhou, Chen Liu, Hao Chen, Wenxuan Li, Zekun Jiang, Ziyan Huang, Yuxuan Zhao, Dexin Yu, Junjun He, Yefeng Zheng, Ling Shao, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou

**Abstract:**  AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23 expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs. It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

**Authors:** Jiayu Wang, Yifei Ming, Riya Dulepet, Qinglin Chen, Austin Xu, Zixuan Ke, Frederic Sala, Aws Albarghouthi, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty

**Abstract:**  Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources -- marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric, reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive, requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive, dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association, consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems, including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

**Authors:** Sven Jacob, Weijia Shao, Gjergji Kasneci

**Abstract:**  Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jsve96/AO-Exp-Attack.

**ArXiv ID:** 2510.14726
**Authors:** Dingzhou Xie, Rushi Lan, Cheng Pang, Enhao Ning, Jiahao Zeng, Wei Zheng

**Abstract:**  Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance, achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

**Abstract:**  Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work, we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality. While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed decision-making.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria. Focuses on biases in causal reasoning in LLMs, which is tangential to the criteria.

## 48. [Combining Reinforcement Learning and Behavior Trees for NPCs in Video Games with AMD Schola](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14154) <a id="link48"></a>

**Abstract:**  While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

**Comment:** Does not closely match any specific criterion but is relevant to reinforcement learning and behavior trees in game AI.
**Relevance:** 3
**Novelty:** 4
